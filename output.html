   disorders, and other comorbid diagnoses. Among individuals who are nonverbal or have
  </p>
  <p>
   language deficits, observable signs such as changes in sleep or eating and increases in chal-
  </p>
  <p>
   lenging behavior should trigger an evaluation for anxiety or depression. Specific learning dif-
  </p>
  <p>
   ficulties (literacy and numeracy) are common, as is developmental coordination disorder.

   Medical conditions commonly associated with autism spectrum disorder should be noted

  <p>
   under the "associated with a known medical/genetic or environmental/acquired condition"
  </p>
  <p>
   specifier. Such medical conditions include epilepsy, sleep problems, and constipation.

   Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder is a fairly frequent presenting feature of autism

   Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Diagnostic Criteria
  </h3>
  <p>
   A.  A  persistent pattern  of inattention  and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that  interferes with
  </p>
  <p>
   functioning or development, as characterized by (1) and/or (2):
  </p>
  <p>
   1.  Inattention:  Six  (or  more)  of the  following  symptoms  have  persisted  for at  least
  </p>
  <p>
   6 months to a degree that is inconsistent with developmental  level and that nega-
  </p>
  <p>
   tively impacts directly on social and academic/occupational activities:
  </p>
  <p>
   Note:  The symptoms are not solely a manifestation of oppositional behavior, defi-
  </p>
  <p>
   ance,  hostility, or failure to understand tasks or instructions.  For older adolescents
  </p>
  <p>
   and adults (age  17 and older), at least five symptoms are required.
  </p>
  <p>
   a.  Often  fails  to  give  close  attention  to  details  or  makes  careless  mistakes  in
  </p>
  <p>
   schoolwork, at work, or during other activities (e.g., overlooks or misses details,
  </p>
  <p>
   work is inaccurate).
  </p>
  <p>
   b.  Often has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities (e.g.,  has diffi-
  </p>
  <p>
   culty remaining focused during lectures, conversations, or lengthy reading).
  </p>
  <p>
   c.  Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly (e.g.,  mind seems else-
  </p>
  <p>
   where, even in the absence of any obvious distraction).
  </p>
  <p>
   d.  Often  does  not  follow  through  on  instructions  and  fails  to  finish  schoolwork,
  </p>
  <p>
   chores, or duties in the workplace (e.g., starts tasks but quickly loses focus and
  </p>
  <p>
   is easily sidetracked).
  </p>
  <p>
   e.  Often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities (e.g., difficulty managing se-
  </p>
  <p>
   quential tasks; difficulty keeping materials and belongings in order; messy, dis-
  </p>
  <p>
   organized work;  has poor time management; fails to meet deadlines).
  </p>
  <p>
   f.  Often avoids, dislikes,  or is reluctant to engage  in tasks that require sustained
  </p>
  <p>
   mental effort (e.g., schoolwork or homework; for older adolescents and adults,
  </p>
  <p>
   preparing reports, completing forms,  reviewing lengthy papers).
  </p>
  <p>
   g.  Often loses things necessary for tasks or activities (e.g., school materials, pen-
  </p>
  <p>
   cils, books, tools, wallets,  keys,  papenwork, eyeglasses,  mobile telephones).
  </p>
  <p>
   h.  Is  often  easily  distracted  by  extraneous  stimuli  (for  older  adolescents  and
  </p>
  <p>
   i.
  </p>
  <p>
   adults,  may include unrelated thoughts).
  </p>
  <p>
   Is often forgetful in daily activities (e.g., doing chores, running errands; for older
  </p>
  <p>
   adolescents and adults,  returning calls,  paying bills,  keeping appointments).
  </p>
  <p>
   2.  Hyperactivity and impuisivity: Six (or more) of the following symptoms have per-
  </p>
  <p>
   sisted for at least 6 months to a degree that is inconsistent with developmental level
  </p>
  <p>
   and that negatively impacts directly on social and academic/occupational activities:
  </p>
  <p>
   Note:  The symptoms  are  not solely a  manifestation  of oppositional  behavior,  defi-
  </p>
  <p>
   ance, hostility, or a failure to understand tasks or instructions.  For older adolescents
  </p>
  <p>
   and adults (age 17 and older), at least five symptoms are required.
  </p>
  <p>
   a.  Often fidgets with or taps hands or feet or squirms in seat.
  </p>
  <p>
   b.  Often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected (e.g., leaves
  </p>
  <p>
   his or her place  in  the classroom,  in  the  office or other workplace,  or in  other
  </p>
  <p>
   situations that require remaining in place).
  </p>
  <p>
   c.  Often runs about or climbs in situations where it is inappropriate.  (Note:  In ad-
  </p>
  <p>
   olescents or adults, may be limited to feeling restless.)
  </p>
  <p>
   d.  Often unable to play or engage in leisure activities quietly.
  </p>
  <p>
   e.
  </p>
  <p>
   Is often “on the go,” acting as if “driven by a motor” (e.g.,  is unable to be or un-
  </p>
  <p>
   comfortable  being  still for extended time,  as  in  restaurants,  meetings;  may be
  </p>
  <p>
   experienced by others as being restless or difficult to keep up with).
  </p>
  <p>
   f.  Often talks excessively.
  </p>
  <p>
   g.  Often  blurts out an answer before a question  has  been completed  (e.g.,  com-
  </p>
  <p>
   pletes people’s sentences; cannot wait for turn in conversation).
  </p>
  <p>
   h.  Often has difficulty waiting his or her turn  (e.g., while waiting in line).
  </p>
  <p>
   i.  Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations,  games, or
  </p>
  <p>
   activities; may start using other people’s things without asking or receiving per-
  </p>
  <p>
   mission; for adolescents and adults,  may intrude into or take over what others
  </p>
  <p>
   are doing).
  </p>
  <p>
   B.  Several  inattentive  or  hyperactive-impulsive  symptoms  were  present  prior to  age
  </p>
  <p>
   12 years.
  </p>
  <p>
   C.  Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms are present in two or more set-
  </p>
  <p>
   tings (e.g., at home, school, or work; with friends or relatives;  in other activities).
  </p>
  <p>
   D.  There is clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or reduce the quality of,  so-
  </p>
  <p>
   cial, academic, or occupational functioning.
  </p>
  <p>
   E.  The symptoms do not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or another
  </p>
  <p>
   psychotic disorder and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., mood
  </p>
  <p>
   disorder, anxiety disorder, dissociative disorder, personality disorder, substance intox-
  </p>
  <p>
   ication or withdrawal).
  </p>
  <p>
   Specify whether:
  </p>
  <p>
   314.01  (F90.2)  Combined  presentation:  If both  Criterion A1  (inattention)  and  Crite-
  </p>
  <p>
   rion A2 (hyperactivity-impulsivity) are met for the past 6 months.
  </p>
  <p>
   314.00 (F90.0)  Predominantly  inattentive  presentation:  If Criterion A1  (inattention)
  </p>
  <p>
   is met but Criterion A2 (hyperactivity-impulsivity) is not met for the past 6 months.
  </p>
  <p>
   314.01  (F90.1) Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation: If Criterion A2 (hy-
  </p>
  <p>
   peractivity-impulsivity) is met and Criterion A1  (inattention) is not met for the past 6 months.
  </p>
  <p>
   Specify if:
  </p>
  <p>
   in partial remission: When full criteria were previously met, fewer than the full criteria
  </p>
  <p>
   have been  met for the  past 6  months,  and the  symptoms  still  result in  impairment in
  </p>
  <p>
   social, academic, or occupational functioning.
  </p>
  <p>
   Specify current severity:
  </p>
  <p>
   lUlild:  Few,  if any,  symptoms  in  excess of those  required  to  make  the  diagnosis  are
  </p>
  <p>
   present, and symptoms result in no more than minor impairments in social or occupa-
  </p>
  <p>
   tional functioning.
  </p>
  <p>
   Moderate: Symptoms or functional impairment between “mild” and “severe” are present.
  </p>
  <p>
   Severe:  Many symptoms in excess of tliose required to mal&lt;e tlie diagnosis, or several
  </p>
  <p>
   symptoms that are particularly severe, are present, or the symptoms result in marked
  </p>
  <p>
   impairment in social or occupational functioning.
  </p>
  <p>
   Diagnostic  Features
  </p>
  <p>
   The essential feature of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a persistent
  </p>
  <p>
   pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or
  </p>
  <p>
   development. Inattention manifests behaviorally in ADHD as wandering off task, lacking
  </p>
  <p>
   persistence, having difficulty sustaining focus, and being disorganized and is not due to
  </p>
  <p>
   defiance or lack of comprehension. Hyperactivity refers to excessive motor activity (such as
  </p>
  <p>
   a child running about) when it is not appropriate, or excessive fidgeting, tapping, or talk-
  </p>
  <p>
   ativeness. In adults, hyperactivity may manifest as extreme restlessness or wearing others
  </p>
  <p>
   out with their activity. Impulsivity refers to hasty actions that occur in the moment without
  </p>
  <p>
   forethought and that have high potential for harm to the individual (e.g., darting into the
  </p>
  <p>
   street without looking). Impulsivity may reflect a desire for immediate rewards or an in-
  </p>
  <p>
   ability to delay gratification. Impulsive behaviors may manifest as social intrusiveness
  </p>
  <p>
   (e.g., interrupting others excessively) and/or as making important decisions without con-
  </p>
  <p>
   sideration of long-term consequences (e.g., taking a job without adequate information).
  </p>
  <p>
   ADHD begins in childhood. The requirement that several symptoms be present before
  </p>
  <p>
   age 12 years conveys the importance of a substantial clinical presentation during child-
  </p>
  <p>
   hood. At the same time, an earlier age at onset is not specified because of difficulties in es-
  </p>
  <p>
   tablishing precise childhood onset retrospectively. Adult recall of childhood symptoms
  </p>
  <p>
   tends to be unreliable, and it is beneficial to obtain ancillary information.
  </p>
  <p>
   Manifestations of the disorder must be present in more than one setting (e.g., home and
  </p>
  <p>
   school, work). Confirmation of substantial symptoms across settings typically cannot be
  </p>
  <p>
   done accurately without consulting informants who have seen the individual in those set-
  </p>
  <p>
   tings. Typically, symptoms vary depending on context within a given setting. Signs of the
  </p>
  <p>
   disorder may be minimal or absent when the individual is receiving frequent rewards for
  </p>
  <p>
   appropriate behavior, is under close supervision, is in a novel setting, is engaged in espe-
  </p>
  <p>
   cially interesting activities, has consistent external stimulation (e.g., via electronic screens),
  </p>
  <p>
   or is interacting in one-on-one situations (e.g., the clinician's office).
  </p>
  <p>
   Associated  Features Supporting  Diagnosis
  </p>
  <p>
   Mild delays in language, motor, or social development are not specific to ADHD but often co-
  </p>
  <p>
   occur. Associated features may include low frustration tolerance, irritability, or mood lability.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even in the absence of a specific learning disorder, academic or work performance is often im-
  </p>
  <p>
   paired. Inattentive behavior is associated with various underlying cognitive processes, and in-
  </p>
  <p>
   dividuals with ADHD may exhibit cognitive problems on tests of attention, executive
  </p>
  <p>
   function, or memory, although these tests are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to serve as di-
  </p>
  <p>
   agnostic indices. By early adulthood, ADHD is associated with an increased risk of suicide at-
  </p>
  <p>
   tempt, primarily when comorbid with mood, conduct, or substance use disorders.
  </p>
  <p>
   No biological marker is diagnostic for ADHD. As a group, compared with peers, chil-
  </p>
  <p>
   dren with ADHD display increased slow wave electroencephalograms, reduced total
  </p>
  <p>
   brain volume on magnetic resonance imaging, and possibly a delay in posterior to anterior
  </p>
  <p>
   cortical maturation, but these findings are not diagnostic. In the uncommon cases where
  </p>
  <p>
   there is a known genetic cause (e.g.. Fragile X syndrome, 22qll  deletion syndrome), the
  </p>
  <p>
   ADHD presentation should still be diagnosed.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Prevalence
  </h3>
  <p>
   Population surveys suggest that ADHD occurs in most cultures in about 5% of children
  </p>
  <p>
   and about 2.5% of adults.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Development and Course
  </h3>
  <p>
   Many parents first observe excessive motor activity when the child is a toddler, but symp-
  </p>
  <p>
   toms are difficult to distinguish from highly variable normative behaviors before age 4
  </p>
  <p>
   years. ADHD is most often identified during elementary school years, and inattention be-
  </p>
  <p>
   comes more prominent and impairing. The disorder is relatively stable through early ad-
  </p>
  <p>
   olescence, but some individuals have a worsened course with development of antisocial
  </p>
  <p>
   behaviors. In most individuals with ADHD, symptoms of motoric hyperactivity become
  </p>
  <p>
   less obvious in adolescence and adulthood, but difficulties with restlessness, inattention,
  </p>
  <p>
   poor planning, and impulsivity persist. A substantial proportion of children with ADHD
  </p>
  <p>
   remain relatively impaired into adulthood.
  </p>
  <p>
   In preschool, the main manifestation is hyperactivity. Inattention becomes more prom-
  </p>
  <p>
   inent during elementary school. During adolescence, signs of hyperactivity (e.g., running
  </p>
  <p>
   and climbing) are less common and may be confined to fidgetiness or an inner feeling of
  </p>
  <p>
   jitteriness, restlessness, or impatience. In adulthood, along with inattention and restless-
  </p>
  <p>
   ness, impulsivity may remain problematic even when hyperactivity has diminished.
  </p>
  <p>
   Risk and  Prognostic Factors
  </p>
  <p>
   Temperamental.  ADHD is associated with reduced behavioral inhibition, effortful con-
  </p>
  <p>
   trol, or constraint; negative emotionality; and/or elevated novelty seeking. These traits
  </p>
  <p>
   may predispose some children to ADHD but are not specific to the disorder.
  </p>
  <p>
   Environmental.  Very low birth weight (less than 1,500 grams) conveys a two- to three-
  </p>
  <p>
   fold risk for ADHD, but most children with low birth weight do not develop ADHD. Al-
  </p>
  <p>
   though ADHD is correlated with smoking during pregnancy, some of this association
  </p>
  <p>
   reflects common genetic risk. A minority of cases may be related to reactions to aspects of
  </p>
  <p>
   diet. There may be a history of child abuse, neglect, multiple foster placements, neurotoxin
  </p>
  <p>
   exposure (e.g., lead), infections (e.g., encephalitis), or alcohol exposure in utero. Exposure
  </p>
  <p>
   to environmental  toxicants has been correlated with subsequent ADHD, but it is not
  </p>
  <p>
   known whether these associations are causal.
  </p>
  <p>
   Genetic and physiological.  ADHD is elevated in the first-degree biological relatives of
  </p>
  <p>
   individuals with ADHD. The heritability of ADHD is substantial. While specific genes
  </p>
  <p>
   have been correlated with ADHD, they are neither necessary nor sufficient causal factors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Visual and hearing impairments, metabolic abnormalities, sleep disorders, nutritional de-
  </p>
  <p>
   ficiencies, and epilepsy should be considered as possible influences on ADHD symptoms.
  </p>
  <p>
   ADHD is not associated with specific physical features, although rates of minor phys-
  </p>
  <p>
   ical anomalies (e.g., hypertelorism, highly arched palate, low-set ears) may be relatively
  </p>
  <p>
   elevated.  Subtle motor delays and other neurological soft signs may occur.  (Note that
  </p>
  <p>
   marked co-occurring clumsiness and motor delays should be coded separately [e.g., de-
  </p>
  <p>
   velopmental coordination disorder].)
  </p>
  <p>
   Course modifiers.  Family interaction patterns in early childhood are unlikely to cause
  </p>
  <p>
   ADHD but may influence its course or contribute to secondary development of conduct
  </p>
  <p>
   problems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cuiture-Reiated  Diagnostic Issues
  </p>
  <p>
   Differences in ADHD prevalence rates across regions appear attributable mainly to differ-
  </p>
  <p>
   ent diagnostic and methodological practices. However, there also may be cultural varia-
  </p>
  <p>
   tion in attitudes toward or interpretations of children's behaviors. Clinical identification
  </p>
  <p>
   rates in the United States for African American and Latino populations tend to be lower
  </p>
  <p>
   than for Caucasian populations.  Informant symptom ratings may be influenced by cul-
  </p>
  <p>
   tural group of the child and the informant, suggeshng that culturally appropriate practices
  </p>
  <p>
   are relevant in assessing ADHD.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gender-Related  Diagnostic Issues
  </p>
  <p>
   ADHD is more frequent in males than in females in the general population, with a ratio of
  </p>
  <p>
   approximately 2:1  in children and 1.6:1  in adults. Females are more likely than males to
  </p>
  <p>
   present primarily with inattentive features.
  </p>
  <p>
   Functional  Consequences of
  </p>
  <p>
   Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
  </p>
  <p>
   ADHD is associated with reduced school performance and academic attainment, social re-
  </p>
  <p>
   jection, and, in adults, poorer occupational performance, attainment, attendance, and
  </p>
  <p>
   higher probability of unemployment as well as elevated interpersonal conflict. Children
  </p>
  <p>
   with ADHD are significantly more likely than their peers without ADHD to develop con-
  </p>
  <p>
   duct disorder in adolescence and antisocial personality disorder in adulthood, conse-
  </p>
  <p>
   quently increasing the likelihood for substance use disorders and incarceration. The risk of
  </p>
  <p>
   subsequent substance use disorders is elevated, especially when conduct disorder or an-
  </p>
  <p>
   tisocial personality disorder develops. Individuals with ADHD are more likely than peers
  </p>
  <p>
   to be injured. Traffic accidents and violations are more frequent in drivers with ADHD.
  </p>
  <p>
   There may be an elevated likelihood of obesity among individuals with ADHD.
  </p>
  <p>
   Inadequate or variable self-application to tasks that require sustained effort is often in-
  </p>
  <p>
   terpreted by others as laziness, irresponsibility, or failure to cooperate. Family relation-
  </p>
  <p>
   ships may be characterized by discord and negative interactions. Peer relationships afe
  </p>
  <p>
   often disrupted by peer rejection, neglect, or teasing of the individual with ADHD. On av-
  </p>
  <p>
   erage, individuals with ADHD obtain less schooling, have poorer vocational achievement,
  </p>
  <p>
   and have reduced intellectual scores than their peers, although there is great variability. In
  </p>
  <p>
   its severe form, the disorder is markedly impairing, affecting social, familial, and scholas-
  </p>
  <p>
   tic/occupational adjustment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Academic deficits, school-related problems, and peer neglect tend to be most associ-
  </p>
  <p>
   ated with elevated symptoms of inattention, whereas peer rejection and, to a lesser extent,
  </p>
  <p>
   accidental injury are most salient with marked symptoms of hyperactivity or impulsivity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Differential  Diagnosis
  </p>
  <p>
   Oppositional defiant disorder.
  </p>
  <p>
   Individuals with oppositional defiant disorder may re-
  </p>
  <p>
   sist work or school tasks that require self-application because they resist conforming to
  </p>
  <p>
   others' demands. Their behavior is characterized by negativity, hostility, and defiance.
  </p>
  <p>
   These symptoms must be differentiated from aversion to school or mentally demanding
  </p>
  <p>
   tasks due to difficulty in sustaining mental effort, forgetting instructions, and impulsivity
  </p>
  <p>
   in individuals with ADHD. Complicating the differential diagnosis is the fact that some
  </p>
  <p>
   individuals with ADHD may develop secondary oppositional attitudes toward such tasks
  </p>
  <p>
   and devalue their importance.
  </p>
  <p>
   Intermittent explosive disorder.  ADHD and intermittent explosive disorder share high
  </p>
  <p>
   levels of impulsive behavior. However, individuals with intermittent explosive disorder
  </p>
  <p>
   show serious aggression toward others, which is not characteristic of ADHD, and they do
  </p>
  <p>
   not experience problems with sustaining attention as seen in ADHD. In addition, intermit-
  </p>
  <p>
   tent explosive disorder is rare in childhood. Intermittent explosive disorder may be diag-
  </p>
  <p>
   nosed in the presence of ADHD.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other neurodevelopmental disorders.  The increased motoric activity that may occur in
  </p>
  <p>
   ADHD must be distinguished from the repetitive motor behavior that characterizes stereo-
  </p>
  <p>
   typic movement disorder and  some cases of autism spectrum disorder.  In stereotypic
  </p>
  <p>
   movement disorder, the motoric behavior is generally fixed and repetitive (e.g., body rock-
  </p>
  <p>
   ing, self-biting), whereas the fidgetiness and restlessness in ADHD are typically general-
  </p>
  <p>
   ized and not characterized by repetitive stereotypic movements.  In Tourette's disorder,
  </p>
  <p>
   frequent multiple tics can be mistaken for the generalized fidgetiness of ADHD. Prolonged
  </p>
  <p>
   observation may be needed to differentiate fidgetiness from bouts of multiple tics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Specific learning disorder.  Children with specific learning disorder may appear inat-
  </p>
  <p>
   tentive because of frustration, lack of interest, or limited ability. However, inattention in
  </p>
  <p>
   individuals with a specific learning disorder who do not have ADHD is not impairing out-
  </p>
  <p>
   side of academic work.
  </p>
  <p>
   Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).  Symptoms of ADHD are
  </p>
  <p>
   common among children placed in academic settings that are inappropriate to their intel-
  </p>
  <p>
   lectual ability. In such cases, the symptoms are not evident during non-academic tasks. A
  </p>
  <p>
   diagnosis of ADHD in intellectual disability requires that inattention or hyperactivity be
  </p>
  <p>
   excessive for mental age.
  </p>
  <p>
   Autism spectrum disorder.
  </p>
  <p>
   Individuals with ADHD and those with autism spectrum
  </p>
  <p>
   disorder exhibit inattention, social dysfunction, and difficult-to-manage behavior. The so-
  </p>
  <p>
   cial dysfunction and peer rejection seen in individuals with ADHD must be distinguished
  </p>
  <p>
   from the social disengagement, isolation, and indifference to facial and tonal communica-
  </p>
  <p>
   tion cues seen in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Children with autism spec-
  </p>
  <p>
   trum disorder may display tantrums because of an inability to tolerate a change from their
  </p>
  <p>
   expected course of events. In contrast, children with ADHD may misbehave or have a tan-
  </p>
  <p>
   trum during a major transition because of impulsivity or poor self-control.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reactive attachment disorder.  Children with reactive attachment disorder may show
  </p>
  <p>
   social disinhibition, but not the full ADHD symptom cluster, and display other features
  </p>
  <p>
   such as a lack of enduring relationships that are not characteristic of ADHD.
  </p>
  <p>
   Anxiety disorders.  ADHD shares symptoms of inattention with anxiety disorders. Indi-
  </p>
  <p>
   viduals with ADHD are inattentive because of their attraction to external stimuli, new
  </p>
  <p>
   activities, or preoccupation with enjoyable activities. This is distinguished from the inat-
  </p>
  <p>
   tention due to worry and rumination seen in anxiety disorders. Restlessness might be seen
  </p>
  <p>
   in anxiety disorders. However, in ADHD, the symptom is not associated with worry and
  </p>
  <p>
   rumination.
  </p>
  <p>
   Depressive disorders.
  </p>
  <p>
   Individuals with depressive disorders may present with inabil-
  </p>
  <p>
   ity to concentrate.  However, poor concentration in mood disorders becomes prominent
  </p>
  <p>
   only during a depressive episode.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bipolar disorder.
  </p>
  <p>
   Individuals with bipolar disorder may have increased activity, poor
  </p>
  <p>
   concentration, and increased impulsivity, but these features are episodic, occurring sev-
  </p>
  <p>
   eral days at a time. In bipolar disorder, increased impulsivity or inattention is accompa-
  </p>
  <p>
   nied by elevated mood, grandiosity, and other specific bipolar features.  Children with
  </p>
  <p>
   ADHD may show significant changes in mood within the same day; such lability is dis-
  </p>
  <p>
   tinct from a manic episode, which must last 4 or more days to be a clinical indicator of bi-
  </p>
  <p>
   polar disorder, even in children.  Bipolar disorder is rare in preadolescents, even when
  </p>
  <p>
   severe irritability and anger are prominent, whereas ADHD is common among children
  </p>
  <p>
   and adolescents who display excessive anger and irritability.
  </p>
  <p>
   Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.  Disruptive mood  dysregulation disorder is
  </p>
  <p>
   characterized by pervasive irritability, and intolerance of frustration, but impulsiveness
  </p>
  <p>
   and disorganized attenhon are not essential features. However, most children and adoles-
  </p>
  <p>
   cents with the disorder have symptoms that also meet criteria for ADHD, which is diag-
  </p>
  <p>
   nosed separately.
  </p>
  <p>
   Substance use disorders.  Differentiating ADHD from substance use disorders may be
  </p>
  <p>
   problematic if the first presentation of ADHD symptoms follows the onset of abuse or fre-
  </p>
  <p>
   quent use. Clear evidence of ADHD before substance misuse from informants or previous
  </p>
  <p>
   records may be essential for differential diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Personality disorders.
  </p>
  <p>
   In adolescents and adults, it may be difficult to distinguish ADHD
  </p>
  <p>
   from borderline, narcissistic, and other personality disorders. All these disorders tend to
  </p>
  <p>
   share the features of disorganization, social intrusiveness, emotional dysregulation, and
  </p>
  <p>
   cognitive dysregulation. However, ADHD is not characterized by fear of abandonment,
  </p>
  <p>
   self-injury, extreme ambivalence, or other features of personality disorder.  It may take
  </p>
  <p>
   extended clinical observation, informant interview, or detailed history to distinguish im-
  </p>
  <p>
   pulsive, socially intrusive, or inappropriate behavior from narcissistic, aggressive, or dom-
  </p>
  <p>
   ineering behavior to make this differential diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Psychotic disorders.  ADHD is not diagnosed if the symptoms of inattention and hyperac-
  </p>
  <p>
   tivity occur exclusively during the course of a psychotic disorder.
  </p>
  <p>
   Medication-induced symptoms of ADHD.  Symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or
  </p>
  <p>
   impulsivity attributable to the use of medication (e.g., bronchodilators, isoniazid, neuro-
  </p>
  <p>
   leptics  [resulting in akathisia], thyroid replacement medication) are diagnosed as other
  </p>
  <p>
   specified or unspecified other (or unknown) substance-related disorders.
  </p>
  <p>
   Neurocognitive disorders.  Early major neurocognitive disorder  (dementia)  and/or
  </p>
  <p>
   mild neurocognitive disorder are not known to be associated with ADHD but may present
  </p>
  <p>
   with similar clinical features. These conditions are distinguished from ADHD by their late
  </p>
  <p>
   onset.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Comorbidity
  </h3>
  <p>
   In clinical settings, comorbid disorders are frequent in individuals whose symptoms meet
  </p>
  <p>
   criteria for ADHD. In the general population, oppositional defiant disorder co-occurs with
  </p>
  <p>
   ADHD in approximately half of children with the combined presentation and about a
  </p>
  <p>
   quarter with the predominantly inattentive presentation. Conduct disorder co-occurs in
  </p>
  <p>
   about a quarter of children or adolescents with the combined presentation, depending on
  </p>
  <p>
   age and setting. Most children and adolescents with disruptive mood dysregulation dis-
  </p>
  <p>
   order have symptoms that also meet criteria for ADHD; a lesser percentage of children
  </p>
  <p>
   with ADHD have symptoms that meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disor-
  </p>
  <p>
   der. Specific learning disorder commonly co-occurs with ADHD. Anxiety disorders and
  </p>
  <p>
   major depressive disorder occur in a minority of individuals with ADHD but more often
  </p>
  <p>
   than in the general population.  Intermittent explosive disorder occurs in a minority of
  </p>
  <p>
   adults with ADHD, but at rates above population levels. Although substance use disor-
  </p>
  <p>
   ders are relatively more frequent among adults with ADHD in the general population, the
  </p>
  <p>
   disorders are present in only a minority of adults with ADHD. In adults, antisocial and
  </p>
  <p>
   other personality disorders may co-occur with ADHD. Other disorders that may co-occur
  </p>
  <p>
   with ADHD include obsessive-compulsive disorder, tic disorders, and autism spectrum
  </p>
  <p>
   disorder.

   Specific Learning Disorder
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Diagnostic Criteria
  </h3>
  <p>
   A.  Difficulties learning and using academic skills, as indicated by the presence of at least
  </p>
  <p>
   one of the following symptoms that have  persisted for at least 6 months,  despite the
  </p>
  <p>
   provision of interventions that target those difficulties:
  </p>
  <p>
   1.  Inaccurate or slow and effortful word reading (e.g., reads single words aloud incor-
  </p>
  <p>
   rectly or slowly  and  hesitantly,  frequently  guesses  words,  has  difficulty  sounding
  </p>
  <p>
   out words).
  </p>
  <p>
   2.  Difficulty understanding the meaning of what is read (e.g., may read text accurately
  </p>
  <p>
   but not understand the sequence, relationships, inferences, or deeper meanings of
  </p>
  <p>
   what is read).
  </p>
  <p>
   3.  Difficulties with spelling (e.g.,  may add, omit, or substitute vowels or consonants).
  </p>
  <p>
   4.  Difficulties with  written  expression  (e.g.,  makes  multiple  grammatical  or  punctua-
  </p>
  <p>
   tion errors within sentences; employs poor paragraph organization; written expres-
  </p>
  <p>
   sion of ideas lacks clarity).
  </p>
  <p>
   5.  Difficulties  mastering  number sense,  number facts,  or calculation  (e.g.,  has  poor
  </p>
  <p>
   understanding of numbers, their magnitude, and relationships; counts on fingers to
  </p>
  <p>
   add single-digit numbers instead of recalling the math fact as peers do; gets lost in
  </p>
  <p>
   the midst of arithmetic computation and may switch procedures).
  </p>
  <p>
   6.  Difficulties with mathematical  reasoning (e.g.,  has severe difficulty applying math-
  </p>
  <p>
   ematical concepts, facts, or procedures to solve quantitative problems).
  </p>
  <p>
   B.  The affected academic skills are substantially and quantifiably below those expected
  </p>
  <p>
   for the individual’s chronological age, and cause significant interference with academic
  </p>
  <p>
   or occupational performance, or with activities of daily living, as confirmed by individu-
  </p>
  <p>
   ally  administered  standardized  achievement  measures  and  comprehensive  clinical
  </p>
  <p>
   assessment. For individuals age 17 years and older, a documented history of impairing
  </p>
  <p>
   learning difficulties may be substituted for the standardized assessment.
  </p>
  <p>
   C.  The learning difficulties begin during school-age years but may not become fully man-
  </p>
  <p>
   ifest until the demands for those affected academic sl&lt;ills exceed the  individual’s lim-
  </p>
  <p>
   ited capacities (e.g., as in timed tests,  reading or writing lengthy complex reports for a
  </p>
  <p>
   tight deadline, excessively heavy academic loads).
  </p>
  <p>
   D.  The learning difficulties are not better accounted for by intellectual disabilities,  uncor-
  </p>
  <p>
   rected visual  or auditory acuity,  other mental  or neurological  disorders,  psychosocial
  </p>
  <p>
   adversity,  lack of  proficiency  in  the  language  of academic  instruction,  or inadequate
  </p>
  <p>
   educational instruction.
  </p>
  <p>
   Note;  The four diagnostic criteria are to be met based on a clinical  synthesis of the  indi-
  </p>
  <p>
   vidual’s history (developmental, medical, family, educational), school reports, and psycho-
  </p>
  <p>
   educational assessment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Coding  note:  Specify all academic domains and subskills that are impaired. When more
  </p>
  <p>
   than one domain  is impaired,  each one should be coded individually according to the fol-
  </p>
  <p>
   lowing specifiers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Specify if:
  </p>
  <p>
   315.00 (F81.0) With  impairment in  reading:
  </p>
  <p>
   Word reading accuracy
  </p>
  <p>
   Reading  rate or fluency
  </p>
  <p>
   Reading comprehension
  </p>
  <p>
   Note: Dyslexia is an alternative term used to refer to a pattern of learning difficulties
  </p>
  <p>
   characterized by problems with accurate or fluent word recognition, poor decoding,
  </p>
  <p>
   and poor spelling abilities.  If dyslexia is used to specify this particular pattern of dif-
  </p>
  <p>
   ficulties,  it  is  important  also to  specify any  additional  difficulties that are  present,
  </p>
  <p>
   such as difficulties with reading comprehension or math reasoning.
  </p>
  <p>
   315.2 (F81.81) W itli  impairment  in written expression:
  </p>
  <p>
   Spelling accuracy
  </p>
  <p>
   Grammar and punctuation accuracy
  </p>
  <p>
   Clarity or organization of written expression
  </p>
  <p>
   315.1  (FBI .2) With  impairment  in  mathematics:
  </p>
  <p>
   Number sense
  </p>
  <p>
   Memorization of arithmetic facts
  </p>
  <p>
   Accurate or fluent calculation
  </p>
  <p>
   Accurate math reasoning
  </p>
  <p>
   Note:  Dyscalculia is an altemative term used to refer to a pattern of difficulties char-
  </p>
  <p>
   acterized  by  problems  processing  numerical  information,  learning  arithmetic facts,
  </p>
  <p>
   and  performing accurate or fluent calculations.  If dyscalculia is used to specify this
  </p>
  <p>
   particular pattern  of mathematic difficulties,  it is  important also to specify any addi-
  </p>
  <p>
   tional difficulties that are present, such as difficulties with math reasoning or word rea-
  </p>
  <p>
   soning accuracy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Specify current severity:
  </p>
  <p>
   lUliid: Some difficulties learning skills in one or two academic domains, but of mild enough
  </p>
  <p>
   severity that the individual may be able to compensate or function well when provided with
  </p>
  <p>
   appropriate accommodations or support services, especially during the school years.
  </p>
  <p>
   Moderate:  Marked difficulties learning skills in one or more academic domains, so that
  </p>
  <p>
   the  individual  is  unlikely to become proficient without some  intervals of intensive and
  </p>
  <p>
   specialized  teaching  during  the  school  years.  Some  accommodations  or  supportive
  </p>
  <p>
   services at least part of the day at school, in the workplace, or at home may be needed
  </p>
  <p>
   to complete activities accurately and efficiently.
  </p>
  <p>
   Severe: Severe difficulties learning skills, affecting several academic domains, so that
  </p>
  <p>
   the  individual  is  unlikely to  learn those  skills without ongoing  intensive  individualized
  </p>
  <p>
   and specialized teaching for most of the school years.  Even with an array of appropri-
  </p>
  <p>
   ate accommodations or services at home, at school, or in the workplace, the individual
  </p>
  <p>
   may not be able to complete all activities efficiently.
  </p>
  <p>
   Recording  Procedures
  </p>
  <p>
   Each impaired academic domain and subskill of specific learning disorder should be re-
  </p>
  <p>
   corded. Because of ICD coding requirements, impairments in reading, impairments in writ-
  </p>
  <p>
   ten expression, and impairments in mathematics, with their corresponding impairments in
  </p>
  <p>
   subskills, must be coded separately. For example, impairments in reading and mathematics
  </p>
  <p>
   and impairments in the subskills of reading rate or fluency, reading comprehension, accu-
  </p>
  <p>
   rate or fluent calculation, and accurate math reasoning would be coded and recorded as
  </p>
  <p>
   315.00 (F81.0) specific learning disorder with impairment in reading, with impairment in
  </p>
  <p>
   reading rate or fluency and impairment in reading comprehension; 315.1  (F81.2) specific
  </p>
  <p>
   learning disorder with impairment in mathematics, with impairment in accurate or fluent
  </p>
  <p>
   calculation and impairment in accurate math reasoning.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Diagnostic Features
  </h3>
  <p>
   Specific learning disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a biological origin that is
  </p>
  <p>
   the basis for abnormalities at a cognitive level that are associated with the behavioral signs
  </p>
  <p>
   of the disorder. The biological origin includes an interaction of genetic, epigenetic, and en-
  </p>
  <p>
   vironmental factors, which affect the brain's ability to perceive or process verbal or non-
  </p>
  <p>
   verbal information efficiently and accurately.
  </p>
  <p>
   One essential feature of specific learning disorder is persistent difficulties learning key-
  </p>
  <p>
   stone academic skills (Criterion A), with onset during the years of formal schooling (i.e., the de-
  </p>
  <p>
   velopmental period). Key academic skills include reading of single words accurately and
  </p>
  <p>
   fluently, reading comprehension, written expression and spelling, arithmetic calculation, and
  </p>
  <p>
   mathematical reasoning (solving mathematical problems). In contrast to talking or walking,
  </p>
  <p>
   which are acquired developmental milestones that emerge with brain maturation, academic
  </p>
  <p>
   skills (e.g., reading, spelling, writing, mathematics) have to be taught and learned explicitly.
  </p>
  <p>
   Specific learning disorder disrupts the normal pattern of learning academic skills; it is not sim-
  </p>
  <p>
   ply a consequence of lack of opportunity of learning or inadequate instruction. Difficulties
  </p>
  <p>
   mastering these key academic skills may also impede learning in other academic subjects (e.g.,
  </p>
  <p>
   history, science, social studies), but those problems are attributable to difficulties learning the
  </p>
  <p>
   underlying academic skills. Difficulties learning to map letters with the sounds of one's lan-
  </p>
  <p>
   guage—^to read printed words (often called dyslexia)—is one of the most common manifesta-
  </p>
  <p>
   tions of specific learning disorder. The learning difficulties manifest as a range of observable,
  </p>
  <p>
   descriptive behaviors or symptoms (as listed in Criteria A1-A6). These clinical symptoms may
  </p>
  <p>
   be observed, probed by means of the clinical interview, or ascertained from school reports, rat-
  </p>
  <p>
   ing scales, or descriptions in previous educational or psychological assessments. The learning
  </p>
  <p>
   difficulties are persistent, not transitory. In children and adolescents, persistence is defined as
  </p>
  <p>
   restricted progress in learning (i.e., no evidence that the individual is catching up with class-
  </p>
  <p>
   mates) for at least 6 months despite the provision of extra help at home or school. For example,
  </p>
  <p>
   difficulties learning to read single words that do not fully or rapidly remit with the provision of
  </p>
  <p>
   instruction in phonological skills or word identification strategies may indicate a specific
  </p>
  <p>
   learning disorder. Evidence of persistent learning difficulties may be derived from cumulative
  </p>
  <p>
   school reports, portfolios of the child's evaluated work, curriculum-based measures, or clinical
  </p>
  <p>
   interview. In adults, persistent difficulty refers to ongoing difficulties in literacy or numeracy
  </p>
  <p>
   skills that manifest during childhood or adolescence, as indicated by cumulative evidence
  </p>
  <p>
   from school reports, evaluated portfolios of work, or previous assessments.
  </p>
  <p>
   A second key feature is that the individual's performance of the affected academic skills is
  </p>
  <p>
   well below average for age (Criterion B). One robust clinical indicator of difficulties learning
  </p>
  <p>
   academic skills is low academic achievement for age or average achievement that is sustain-
  </p>
  <p>
   able only by extraordinarily high levels of effort or support. In children, the low academic skills
  </p>
  <p>
   cause significant interference in school performance (as indicated by school reports and
  </p>
  <p>
   teacher's grades or ratings). Another clinical indicator, particularly in adults, is avoidance of
  </p>
  <p>
   activities that require the academic skills. Also in adulthood, low academic skills interfere with
  </p>
  <p>
   occupational performance or everyday activities requiring those skills (as indicated by self-re-
  </p>
  <p>
   port or report by others). However, this criterion also requires psychometric evidence from an
  </p>
  <p>
   individually administered, psychometrically sound and culturally appropriate test of aca-
  </p>
  <p>
   demic achievement that is norm-referenced or criterion-referenced. Academic skills are dis-
  </p>
  <p>
   tributed along a continuum, so there is no natural cutpoint that can be used to differentiate
  </p>
  <p>
   individuals with and without specific learning disorder. Thus, any threshold used to specify
  </p>
  <p>
   what constitutes significantly low academic achievement (e.g., academic skills weU below age
  </p>
  <p>
   expectation) is to a large extent arbitrary. Low achievement scores on one or more standard-
  </p>
  <p>
   ized tests or subtests within an academic domain (i.e., at least 1.5 standard deviations [SD] be-
  </p>
  <p>
   low the population mean for age, which translates to a standard score of 78 or less, which is
  </p>
  <p>
   below the 7th percentile) are needed for the greatest diagnostic certainty. However, precise
  </p>
  <p>
   scores will vary according to the particular standardized tests that are used. On the basis of
  </p>
  <p>
   clinical judgment, a more lenient threshold may be used (e.g., 1.0-2.5 SD below the pop-
  </p>
  <p>
   ulation mean for age), when learning difficulties are supported by converging evidence
  </p>
  <p>
   from clinical assessment, academic history, school reports, or test scores. Moreover, since
  </p>
  <p>
   standardized tests are not available in all languages, the diagnosis may then be based in
  </p>
  <p>
   part on clinical judgment of scores on available test measures.
  </p>
  <p>
   A third core feature is that the learning difficulties are readily apparent in the early
  </p>
  <p>
   school years in most individuals (Criterion C). However, in others, the learning difficulties
  </p>
  <p>
   may not manifest fully until later school years, by which time learning demands have in-
  </p>
  <p>
   creased and exceed the individual's limited capacities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another key diagnostic feature is that the learning difficulties are considered  "spe-
  </p>
  <p>
   cific," for four reasons. First, they are not attributable to intellectual disabilities (intellec-
  </p>
  <p>
   tual  disability  [intellectual  developmental  disorder]);  global  developmental  delay;
  </p>
  <p>
   hearing or vision disorders, or neurological or motor disorders)  (Criterion D). Specific
  </p>
  <p>
   learning disorder affects learning in individuals who otherwise demonstrate normal lev-
  </p>
  <p>
   els of intellectual functioning (generally estimated by an IQ score of greater than about 70
  </p>
  <p>
   [±5 points allowing for measurement error]). The phrase "unexpected academic under-
  </p>
  <p>
   achievement" is often cited as the defining characteristic of specific learning disorder in
  </p>
  <p>
   that the specific learning disabilities are not part of a more general learning difficulty as
  </p>
  <p>
   manifested in intellectual disability or global developmental delay. Specific learning dis-
  </p>
  <p>
   order may also occur in individuals identified as intellectually "gifted." These individuals
  </p>
  <p>
   may be able to sustain apparentiy adequate academic functioning by using compensatory
  </p>
  <p>
   strategies, extraordinarily high effort, or support, until the learning demands or assess-
  </p>
  <p>
   ment procedures (e.g., timed tests) pose barriers to their demonstrating their learning or
  </p>
  <p>
   accomplishing required tasks. Second, the learning difficulty cannot be attributed to more
  </p>
  <p>
   general external factors, such as economic or environmental disadvantage, chronic absen-
  </p>
  <p>
   teeism, or lack of education as typically provided in the individual's community context.
  </p>
  <p>
   Third, the learning difficulty cannot be attributed to a neurological (e.g., pediatric stroke)
  </p>
  <p>
   or motor disorders or to vision or hearing disorders, which are often associated with prob-
  </p>
  <p>
   lems learning academic skills but are distinguishable by presence of neurological signs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, the learning difficulty may be restricted to one academic skill or domain (e.g., read-
  </p>
  <p>
   ing single words, retrieving or calculating number facts).
  </p>
  <p>
   Comprehensive assessment is required. Specific learning disorder can only be diagnosed
  </p>
  <p>
   after formal education starts but can be diagnosed at any point afterward in children, adoles-
  </p>
  <p>
   cents, or adults, providing there is evidence of onset during the years of formal schooling (i.e.,
  </p>
  <p>
   the developmental period). No single data source is sufficient for a diagnosis of specific learn-
  </p>
  <p>
   ing disorder. Rather, specific learning disorder is a clinical diagnosis based on a synthesis of
  </p>
  <p>
   the individual's medical, developmental, educational, and family history; the history of the
  </p>
  <p>
   learning difficulty, including its previous and current manifestation; the impact of the diffi-
  </p>
  <p>
   culty on academic, occupational, or social functioning; previous or current school reports;
  </p>
  <p>
   portfolios of work requiring academic skills; curriculum-based assessments; and previous or
  </p>
  <p>
   current scores from individual standardized tests of academic achievement. If an intellectual,
  </p>
  <p>
   sensory, neurological, or motor disorder is suspected, then the clinical assessment for specific
  </p>
  <p>
   learning disorder should also include methods appropriate for these disorders. Thus, compre-
  </p>
  <p>
   hensive assessment will involve professionals with expertise in specific learning disorder and
  </p>
  <p>
   psychological/cognitive assessment. Since specific learning disorder typically persists into
  </p>
  <p>
   adulthood, reassessment is rarely necessary, unless indicated by marked changes in the learn-
  </p>
  <p>
   ing difficulties (amelioration or worsening) or requested for specific purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Associated  Features Supporting  Diagnosis
  </p>
  <p>
   Specific learning disorder is frequently but not invariably preceded, in preschool years, by
  </p>
  <p>
   delays in attention, language, or motor skills that may persist and co-occur with specific
  </p>
  <p>
   learning disorder. An uneven profile of abilities is common, such as above-average abili-
  </p>
  <p>
   ties in drawing, design, and other visuospatial abilities, but slow, effortful, and inaccurate
  </p>
  <p>
   reading and poor reading comprehension and written expression. Individuals with spe-
  </p>
  <p>
   cific learning disorder typically (but not invariably) exhibit poor performance on psycho-
  </p>
  <p>
   logical tests of cognitive processing. However, it remains unclear whether these cognitive
  </p>
  <p>
   abnormalities are the cause, correlate, or consequence of the learning difficulties. Also, al-
  </p>
  <p>
   though cognitive deficits associated with difficulties learning to read words are well doc-
  </p>
  <p>
   umented, those associated with other manifestations of specific learning disorder (e.g.,
  </p>
  <p>
   reading comprehension, arithmetic computation, written expression) are underspecified
  </p>
  <p>
   or unknown. Moreover, individuals with similar behavioral symptoms or test scores are
  </p>
  <p>
   found to have a variety of cognitive deficits, and many of these processing deficits are also
  </p>
  <p>
   found in other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disor-
  </p>
  <p>
   der [ADHD], autistic spectrum disorder, communication disorders, developmental coor-
  </p>
  <p>
   dination disorder). Thus, assessment of cognitive processing deficits is not required for
  </p>
  <p>
   diagnostic assessment. Specific learning disorder is associated with increased risk for sui-
  </p>
  <p>
   cidal ideation and suicide attempts in children, adolescents, and adults.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are no known biological markers of specific learning disorder. As a group, indi-
  </p>
  <p>
   viduals with the disorder show circumscribed alterations in cognitive processing and
  </p>
  <p>
   brain structure and function. Genetic differences are also evident at the group level. But
  </p>
  <p>
   cognitive testing, neuroimaging, or genetic testing are not useful for diagnosis at this time.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Prevalence
  </h3>
  <p>
   The prevalence of specific learning disorder across the academic domains of reading, writ-
  </p>
  <p>
   ing, and mathematics is 5%-15% among school-age children across different languages
  </p>
  <p>
   and cultures. Prevalence in adults is unknown but appears to be approximately 4%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Development and  Course
  </p>
  <p>
   Onset, recognition, and diagnosis of specific learning disorder usually occurs during the
  </p>
  <p>
   elementary school years when children are required to learn to read, spell, write, and learn
  </p>
  <p>
   mathematics.  However, precursors such as language delays or deficits, difficulties in
  </p>
  <p>
   rhyming or counting, or difficulties with fine motor skills required for writing commonly
  </p>
  <p>
   occur in early childhood before the start of formal schooling. Manifestations may be be-
  </p>
  <p>
   havioral (e.g., a reluctance to engage in learning; oppositional behavior). Specific learning
  </p>
  <p>
   disorder is lifelong, but the course and clinical expression are variable, in part depending
  </p>
  <p>
   on the interactions among the task demands of the environment, the range and severity of
  </p>
  <p>
   the individual's learning difficulties, the individual's learning abilities, comorbidity, and
  </p>
  <p>
   the available support systems and intervention. Nonetheless, problems with reading flu-
  </p>
  <p>
   ency and comprehension, spelling, written expression, and numeracy skills in everyday life
  </p>
  <p>
   typically persist into adulthood.
  </p>
  <p>
   Changes in manifestation of symptoms occur with age, so that an individual may have
  </p>
  <p>
   a persistent or shifting array of learning difficulties across the lifespan.
  </p>
  <p>
   Examples of symptoms that may be observed among preschool-age children include a lack
  </p>
  <p>
   of interest in playing games with language sounds (e.g., repetition, rhyming), and they may
  </p>
  <p>
   have trouble learning nursery rhymes. Preschool children with specific learning disorder may
  </p>
  <p>
   frequently use baby talk, mispronounce words, and have trouble remembering names of let-
  </p>
  <p>
   ters, numbers, or days of the week. They may fail to recognize letters in their own names and
  </p>
  <p>
   have trouble learning to count. Kindergarten-age children with specific learning disorder may
  </p>
  <p>
   be unable to recognize and write letters, may be unable to write their own names, or may use
  </p>
  <p>
   invented spelling. They may have trouble breaking down spoken words into syllables (e.g.,
  </p>
  <p>
   "cowboy" into "cow" and "boy") and trouble recognizing words that rhyme (e.g., cat, bat, hat).
  </p>
  <p>
   Kindergarten-age children also may have trouble cormecting letters with their sounds (e.g., let-
  </p>
  <p>
   ter b makes the sound  /b/) and may be unable to recognize phonemes (e.g., do not know
  </p>
  <p>
   which in a set of words [e.g., dog, man, car] starts with the same sound as "cat").
  </p>
  <p>
   Specific learning disorder in elementary school-age children typically manifests as
  </p>
  <p>
   marked difficulty learning letter-sound correspondence (particularly in English-speaking
  </p>
  <p>
   children), fluent word decoding, spelling, or math facts; reading aloud is slow, inaccurate,
  </p>
  <p>
   and effortful, and some children struggle to understand the magnitude that a spoken or
  </p>
  <p>
   written number represents. Children in primary grades (grades 1-3) may continue to have
  </p>
  <p>
   problems recognizing and manipulating phonemes, be unable to read common one-sylla-
  </p>
  <p>
   ble words  (such as mat or top), and be unable recognize common irregularly spelled
  </p>
  <p>
   words (e.g., said, two). They may commit reading errors that indicate problems in con-
  </p>
  <p>
   necting sounds and letters (e.g., "big" for "got") and have difficulty sequencing numbers
  </p>
  <p>
   and letters. Children in grades 1-3 also may have difficulty remembering number facts or
  </p>
  <p>
   arithmetic procedures for adding, subtracting, and so forth, and may complain that read-
  </p>
  <p>
   ing or arithmetic is hard and avoid doing it. Children with specific learning disorder in the
  </p>
  <p>
   middle grades (grades 4-6) may mispronounce or skip parts of long, multisyllable words
  </p>
  <p>
   (e.g., say  "conible"  for "convertible,"  "aminal"  for "animal")  and confuse words that
  </p>
  <p>
   sound alike (e.g., "tornado" for "volcano"). They may have trouble remembering dates,
  </p>
  <p>
   names, and telephone numbers and may have trouble completing homework or tests on
  </p>
  <p>
   time. Children in the middle grades also may have poor comprehension with or without
  </p>
  <p>
   slow, effortful, and inaccurate reading, and they may have trouble reading small function
  </p>
  <p>
   words (e.g., that, the, an, in). They may have very poor spelling and poor written work.
  </p>
  <p>
   They may get the first part of a word correctly, then guess wildly (e.g., read "clover" as
  </p>
  <p>
   "clock"), and may express fear of reading aloud or refuse to read aloud.
  </p>
  <p>
   By contrast, adolescents may have mastered word decoding, but reading remains slow
  </p>
  <p>
   and effortful, and they are likely to show marked problems in reading comprehension and
  </p>
  <p>
   written expression (including poor spelling) and poor mastery of math facts or mathemat-
  </p>
  <p>
   ical problem solving.  During adolescence and into adulthood, individuals with specific
  </p>
  <p>
   learning disorder may continue to make numerous spelling mistakes and read single
  </p>
  <p>
   words and connected text slowly and with much effort, with trouble pronouncing multi-
  </p>
  <p>
   syllable words. They may frequently need to reread material to understand or get the main
  </p>
  <p>
   point and have trouble making inferences from written text. Adolescents and adults may
  </p>
  <p>
   avoid activities that demand reading or arithmetic (reading for pleasure, reading instruc-
  </p>
  <p>
   tions). Adults with specific learning disorder have ongoing spelling problems, slow and
  </p>
  <p>
   effortful reading, or problems making important inferences from numerical information
  </p>
  <p>
   in work-related written documents. They may avoid both leisure and work-related activ-
  </p>
  <p>
   ities that demand reading or writing or use alternative approaches to access print (e.g.,
  </p>
  <p>
   text-to-speech/speech-to-text software, audiobooks, audiovisual media).
  </p>
  <p>
   An alternative clinical expression is that of circumscribed learning difficulties that per-
  </p>
  <p>
   sist across the lifespan, such as an inability to master the basic sense of number  (e.g., to
  </p>
  <p>
   know which of a pair of numbers or dots represents the larger magnitude), or lack of pro-
  </p>
  <p>
   ficiency in word identification or spelling. Avoidance of or reluctance to engage in activi-
  </p>
  <p>
   ties requiring academic skills is common in children, adolescents, and adults. Episodes of
  </p>
  <p>
   severe anxiety or anxiety disorders, including somatic complaints or panic attacks, are
  </p>
  <p>
   common across the lifespan and accompany both the circumscribed and the broader ex-
  </p>
  <p>
   pression of learning difficulties.
  </p>
  <p>
   Risk and  Prognostic  Factors
  </p>
  <p>
   Environmental.  Prematurity  or very low birth weight increases  the  risk for  specific
  </p>
  <p>
   learning disorder, as does prenatal exposure to nicotine.
  </p>
  <p>
   Genetic and  physiological.  Specific learning disorder appears to aggregate in families,
  </p>
  <p>
   particularly when affecting reading, mathematics, and spelling. The relative risk of spe-
  </p>
  <p>
   cific learning disorder in reading or mathematics is substantially higher (e.g., 4-8 times
  </p>
  <p>
   and 5-10 times higher, respectively)  in first-degree relatives of individuals with these
  </p>
  <p>
   learning difficulties compared with those without them. Family history of reading diffi-
  </p>
  <p>
   culties (dyslexia) and parental literacy skills predict literacy problems or specific learning
  </p>
  <p>
   disorder in offspring, indicating the combined role of genetic and environmental factors.
  </p>
  <p>
   There is high heritability for both reading ability and reading disability in alphabetic and
  </p>
  <p>
   nonalphabetic languages, including high heritability for most manifestations of learning abil-
  </p>
  <p>
   ities and disabilities (e.g., heritability estimate values greater than 0.6). Covariation between
  </p>
  <p>
   various manifestations of learning difficulties is high, suggesting that genes related to one
  </p>
  <p>
   presentation are highly correlated with genes related to another manifestation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Course modifiers.  Marked problems with inattentive behavior in preschool years is pre-
  </p>
  <p>
   dictive of later difficulties in reading and mathematics (but not necessarily specific learn-
  </p>
  <p>
   ing disorder) and nonresponse to effective academic interventions. Delay or disorders in
  </p>
  <p>
   speech or language, or impaired  cognitive processing  (e.g.,  phonological  awareness,
  </p>
  <p>
   working memory, rapid serial naming) in preschool years, predicts later specific learning
  </p>
  <p>
   disorder in reading and written expression.  Comorbidity with ADHD is predictive of
  </p>
  <p>
   worse mental health outcome than that associated with specific learning disorder without
  </p>
  <p>
   ADHD. Systematic, intensive, individualized instruction, using evidence-based interven-
  </p>
  <p>
   tions, may improve or ameliorate the learning difficulties in some individuals or promote
  </p>
  <p>
   the use of compensatory strategies in others, thereby mitigating the otherwise poor out-
  </p>
  <p>
   comes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Culture-Related  Diagnostic  issues
  </p>
  <p>
   Specific learning disorder occurs across languages, cultures, races, and  socioeconomic
  </p>
  <p>
   conditions but may vary in its manifestation according to the nature of the spoken and
  </p>
  <p>
   written symbol systems and cultural and educational practices. For example, the cognitive
  </p>
  <p>
   processing requirements of reading and of working with numbers vary greatly across or-
  </p>
  <p>
   thographies. In the English language, the observable hallmark clinical symptom of diffi-
  </p>
  <p>
   culties learning to read is inaccurate and slow reading of single words; in other alphabetic
  </p>
  <p>
   languages that have more direct mapping between sounds and letters (e.g., Spanish, Ger-
  </p>
  <p>
   man) and in non-alphabetic languages (e.g., Chinese, Japanese), the hallmark feature is
  </p>
  <p>
   slow but accurate reading. In English-language learners, assessment should include con-
  </p>
  <p>
   sideration of whether the source of reading difficulties is a limited proficiency with Eng-
  </p>
  <p>
   lish or a specific learning disorder. Risk factors for specific learning disorder in English-
  </p>
  <p>
   language learners include a family history of specific learning disorder or language delay
  </p>
  <p>
   in the native language, as well as learning difficulties in English and failure to catch up
  </p>
  <p>
   with peers. If there is suspicion of cultural or language differences (e.g., as in an English-
  </p>
  <p>
   language learner), the assessment needs to take into account the individual's language
  </p>
  <p>
   proficiency in his or her first or native language as well as in the second language (in this
  </p>
  <p>
   example, English). Also, assessment should consider the linguistic and cultural context in
  </p>
  <p>
   which the individual is living, as well as his or her educational and learning history in the
  </p>
  <p>
   original culture and language.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gender-Related  Diagnostic  issues
  </p>
  <p>
   Specific learning disorder is more common in males than in females  (ratios range from
  </p>
  <p>
   about 2:1 to 3:1) and cannot be attributed to factors such as ascertainment bias, definitional
  </p>
  <p>
   or measurement variation, language, race, or socioeconomic status.
  </p>
  <p>
   Functionai  Consequences of
  </p>
  <p>
   Specific  Learning  Disorder
  </p>
  <p>
   Specific learning disorder can have negative functional consequences across the lifespan,
  </p>
  <p>
   including lower academic attainment, higher rates of high school dropout, lower rates of
  </p>
  <p>
   postsecondary education, high levels of psychological distress and poorer overall mental
  </p>
  <p>
   health, higher rates of unemployment and under-employment, and lower incomes. School
  </p>
  <p>
   dropout and co-occurring depressive symptoms increase the risk for poor mental health
  </p>
  <p>
   outcomes, including suicidality, whereas high levels of social or emotional support predict
  </p>
  <p>
   better mental health outcomes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Differential  Diagnosis
  </p>
  <p>
   Normal variations in academic attainment.  Specific learning disorder is distinguished
  </p>
  <p>
   from normal variations in academic attainment due to external factors (e.g., lack of edu-
  </p>
  <p>
   cational opportunity, consistently poor instruction, learning in a second language), be-
  </p>
  <p>
   cause the learning difficulties persist in the presence of adequate educational opportunity
  </p>
  <p>
   and exposure to the same instruction as the peer group, and competency in the language of
  </p>
  <p>
   instruction, even when it is different from one's primary spoken language.
  </p>
  <p>
   Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).  Specific  learning disorder
  </p>
  <p>
   differs from general learning difficulties associated with intellectual disability, because the
  </p>
  <p>
   learning difficulties occur in the presence of normal levels of intellectual functioning (i.e.,
  </p>
  <p>
   IQ score of at least 70 ± 5). If intellectual disability is present, specific learning disorder can
  </p>
  <p>
   be diagnosed only when the learning difficulties are in excess of those usually associated
  </p>
  <p>
   with the intellectual disability.
  </p>
  <p>
   Learning difficulties due to neurological or sensory disorders.  Specific  learning  dis-
  </p>
  <p>
   order is distinguished from learning difficulties due to neurological or sensory disorders
  </p>
  <p>
   (e.g., pediatric stroke, traumatic brain injury, hearing impairment, vision impairment), be-
  </p>
  <p>
   cause in these cases there are abnormal findings on neurological examination.
  </p>
  <p>
   Neurocognitive disorders.  Specific learning disorder is distinguished  from learning
  </p>
  <p>
   problems associated  with neurodegenerative cognitive disorders, because  in specific
  </p>
  <p>
   learning disorder the clinical expression of specific learning difficulties occurs during the
  </p>
  <p>
   developmental period, and the difficulties do not manifest as a marked decline from a for-
  </p>
  <p>
   mer state.
  </p>
  <p>
   Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.  Specific learning disorder is distinguished from
  </p>
  <p>
   the poor academic performance associated with ADHD, because in the latter condition the
  </p>
  <p>
   problems may not necessarily reflect specific difficulties in learning academic skills but
  </p>
  <p>
   rather may reflect difficulties in performing those skills. However, the co-occurrence of
  </p>
  <p>
   specific learning disorder and ADHD is more frequent than expected by chance. If criteria
  </p>
  <p>
   for both disorders are met, both diagnoses can be given.
  </p>
  <p>
   Psychotic disorders.  Specific learning disorder is distinguished from the academic and
  </p>
  <p>
   cognitive-processing difficulties associated with schizophrenia or psychosis, because with
  </p>
  <p>
   these disorders there is a decline (often rapid) in these functional domains.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Comorbidity
  </h3>
  <p>
   Specific learning disorder commonly co-occurs with neurodevelopmental (e.g., ADHD,
  </p>
  <p>
   communication disorders, developmental coordination disorder, autistic spectrum disor-
  </p>
  <p>
   der) or other mental disorders (e.g., anxiety disorders, depressive and bipolar disorders).
  </p>
  <p>
   These comorbidities do not necessarily exclude the diagnosis specific learning disorder
  </p>
  <p>
   but may make testing and differential diagnosis more difficult, because each of the co-
  </p>
  <p>
   occurring disorders independently interferes with the execution of activities of daily liv-
  </p>
  <p>
   ing, including learning. Thus, clinical judgment is required to attribute such impairment to
  </p>
  <p>
   learning difficulties. If there is an indication that another diagnosis could account for the
  </p>
  <p>
   difficulties learning keystone academic skills described in Criterion A, specific learning
  </p>
  <p>
   disorder should not be diagnosed.
  </p>
  <h1>
   Motor Disorders
  </h1>
  <h2>
   Developmental Coordination Disorder
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Diagnostic Criteria
  </h3>
  <p>
   315.4 (F82)
  </p>
  <p>
   A.  The acquisition and execution of coordinated motor skills is substantially below that ex-
  </p>
  <p>
   pected  given  the  individual’s chronological  age  and  opportunity for skill  learning  and
  </p>
  <p>
   use.  Difficulties are manifested as clumsiness (e.g., dropping or bumping into objects)
  </p>
  <p>
   as well  as slowness and  inaccuracy of performance of motor skills (e.g.,  catching  an
  </p>
  <p>
   object,  using scissors or cutlery,  handwriting,  riding a bike, or participating in sports).
  </p>
  <p>
   B.  The motor skills deficit in Criterion A significantly and persistently interferes with activ-
  </p>
  <p>
   ities  of  daily  living  appropriate  to  chronological  age  (e.g.,  self-care  and  self-mainte-
  </p>
  <p>
   nance)  and  impacts  academic/school  productivity,  prevocational  and  vocational
  </p>
  <p>
   activities,  leisure, and play.
  </p>
  <p>
   C.  Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.
  </p>
  <p>
   D.  The motor skills deficits are not better explained by intellectual disability (Intellectual devel-
  </p>
  <p>
   opmental disorder) or visual impairment and are not attributable to a neurological condi-
  </p>
  <p>
   tion affecting movement (e.g., cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, degenerative disorder).
  </p>
  <p>
   Diagnostic  Features
  </p>
  <p>
   The diagnosis of developmental coordinahon disorder is made by a clinical synthesis of the
  </p>
  <p>
   history (developmental and medical), physical examination, school or workplace report, and
  </p>
  <p>
   individual assessment using psychometrically sound and culturally appropriate standardized
  </p>
  <p>
   tests. The manifestation of impaired skills requiring motor coordination (Criterion A) varies
  </p>
  <p>
   with age. Young children may be delayed in achieving motor milestones (i.e., sitting, crawling,
  </p>
  <p>
   walking), although many achieve typical motor milestones. They also may be delayed in de-
  </p>
  <p>
   veloping skills such as negotiating stairs, pedaling, buttoning shirts, completing puzzles, and
  </p>
  <p>
   using zippers. Even when the skill is achieved, movement execution may appear awkward,
  </p>
  <p>
   slow, or less precise than that of peers. Older children and adults may display slow speed or in-
  </p>
  <p>
   accuracy with motor aspects of activities such as assembling puzzles, building models, playing
  </p>
  <p>
   ball games (especially in teams), handwriting, typing, driving, or carrying out self-care sldlls.
  </p>
  <p>
   Developmental coordination disorder is diagnosed only if the impairment in motor
  </p>
  <p>
   skills significantly interferes with the performance of, or participation in, daily activities in
  </p>
  <p>
   family, social, school, or community life (Criterion B). Examples of such activities include
  </p>
  <p>
   getting dressed, eating meals with age-appropriate utensils and without mess, engaging
  </p>
  <p>
   in physical games with others, using specific tools in class such as rulers and scissors, and
  </p>
  <p>
   participating in team exercise activities at school. Not only is ability to perform these ac-
  </p>
  <p>
   tions impaired, but also marked slowness in execution is common. Handwriting compe-
  </p>
  <p>
   tence is frequently affected, consequently affecting legibility and/or speed of written output
  </p>
  <p>
   and affecting academic achievement (the impact is distinguished from specific learning
  </p>
  <p>
   difficulty by the emphasis on the motoric component of written output skills). In adults,
  </p>
  <p>
   everyday skills in education and work, especially those in which speed and accuracy are
  </p>
  <p>
   required, are affected by coordination problems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Criterion C states that the onset of symptoms of developmental coordination disorder
  </p>
  <p>
   must be in the early developmental period. However, developmental coordination disorder is
  </p>
  <p>
   typically not diagnosed before age 5 years because there is considerable variation in the age at
  </p>
  <p>
   acquisition of many motor skills or a lack of stability of measurement in early childhood (e.g.,
  </p>
  <p>
   some children catch up) or because other causes of motor delay may not have fully manifested.
  </p>
  <p>
   Criterion D specifies that the diagnosis of developmental coordination disorder is
  </p>
  <p>
   made if the coordination difficulties are not better explained by visual impairment or at-
  </p>
  <p>
   tributable to a neurological condition. Thus, visual function examination and neurological
  </p>
  <p>
   examination must be included in the diagnostic evaluation. If intellectual disability (intel-
  </p>
  <p>
   lectual developmental disorder) is present, the motor difficulties are in excess of those ex-
  </p>
  <p>
   pected for the mental age; however, no IQ cut-off or discrepancy criterion is specified.
  </p>
  <p>
   Developmental coordination disorder does not have discrete subtypes; however, indi-
  </p>
  <p>
   viduals may be impaired predominantly in gross motor skills or in fine motor skills, in-
  </p>
  <p>
   cluding handwriting skills.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other terms used to describe developmental coordination disorder include childhood
  </p>
  <p>
   dyspraxia, specific developmental disorder of motor function, and clumsy child syndrome.
  </p>
  <p>
   Associated  Features Supporting  Diagnosis
  </p>
  <p>
   Some children with developmental coordination disorder show additional (usually sup-
  </p>
  <p>
   pressed) motor activity, such as choreiform movements of unsupported limbs or mirror
  </p>
  <p>
   movements. These "overflow" movements are referred to as neurodevelopmental immaturities or
  </p>
  <p>
   neurological soft signs rather than neurological abnormalities. In both current literature and
  </p>
  <p>
   clinical practice, their role in diagnosis is still unclear, requiring further evaluation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prevaience
  </p>
  <p>
   The prevalence of developmental coordination disorder in children ages 5-11 years is 5%-
  </p>
  <p>
   6% (in children age 7 years, 1.8% are diagnosed with severe developmental coordination
  </p>
  <p>
   disorder and 3% with probable developmental coordination disorder). Males are more of-
  </p>
  <p>
   ten affected than females, with a maleifemale ratio between 2:1  and 7:1.
  </p>
  <p>
   Development and  Course
  </p>
  <p>
   The course of developmental coordination disorder is variable but stable at least to 1 year
  </p>
  <p>
   follow-up. Although there may be improvement in the longer term, problems with coor-
  </p>
  <p>
   dinated movements continue through adolescence in an estimated 50%-70% of children.
  </p>
  <p>
   Onset is in early childhood. Delayed motor milestones may be the first signs, or the disor-
  </p>
  <p>
   der is first recognized when the child attempts tasks such as holding a knife and fork, but-
  </p>
  <p>
   toning clothes, or playing ball games.  In middle childhood,  there are difficulties with
  </p>
  <p>
   motor aspects of assembling puzzles, building models, playing ball, and handwriting, as
  </p>
  <p>
   well as with organizing belongings, when motor sequencing and coordination are re-
  </p>
  <p>
   quired. In early adulthood, there is continuing difficulty in learning new tasks involving
  </p>
  <p>
   complex/automatic motor skills, including driving and using tools. Inability to take notes
  </p>
  <p>
   and handwrite quickly may affect performance in the workplace.  Co-occurrence with
  </p>
  <p>
   other disorders (see the section "Comorbidity" for this disorder) has an additional impact
  </p>
  <p>
   on presentation, course, and outcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   Risk and  Prognostic  Factors
  </p>
  <p>
   Environmental.  Developmental coordination disorder is more common following pre-
  </p>
  <p>
   natal exposure to alcohol and in preterm and low-birth-weight children.
  </p>
  <p>
   Genetic and physiological.
  </p>
  <p>
   Impairments in underlying neurodevelopmental processes—
  </p>
  <p>
   particularly in visual-motor skills, both in visual-motor perception and spatial mentalizing—
  </p>
  <p>
   have been found and affect the ability to make rapid motoric adjustments as the complexity of
  </p>
  <p>
   the required movements increases. Cerebellar dysfunction has been proposed, but the neural
  </p>
  <p>
   basis of developmental coordination disorder remains unclear. Because of the co-occurrence of
  </p>
  <p>
   developmental coordination disorder with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
  </p>
  <p>
   specific learning disabilities, and autism spectrum disorder, shared genetic effect has been pro-
  </p>
  <p>
   posed. However, consistent co-occurrence in twins appears only in severe cases.
  </p>
  <p>
   Course modifiers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Individuals with ADHD and with developmental coordination dis-
  </p>
  <p>
   order demonstrate more impairment than individuals with ADHD without developmen-
  </p>
  <p>
   tal coordination disorder.
  </p>
  <p>
   Culture-Related  Diagnostic  issues
  </p>
  <p>
   Developmental coordination disorder occurs across cultures, races, and socioeconomic
  </p>
  <p>
   conditions. By definition, "activities of daily living" implies cultural differences necessi-
  </p>
  <p>
   tating consideration  of the  context in which the  individual  child  is  living  as  well  as
  </p>
  <p>
   whether he or she has had appropriate opportunities to learn and practice such activities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Functional  Consequences of
  </p>
  <p>
   Developmental  Coordination  Disorder
  </p>
  <p>
   Developmental coordination disorder leads to impaired functional performance in activ-
  </p>
  <p>
   ities of daily living (Criterion B), and the impairment is increased with co-occurring con-
  </p>
  <p>
   ditions.  Consequences  of  developmental  coordination  disorder  include  reduced
  </p>
  <p>
   participation in team play and sports; poor self-esteem and sense of self-worth; emotional
  </p>
  <p>
   or behavior problems; impaired academic achievement; poor physical  fitness; and re-
  </p>
  <p>
   duced physical activity and obesity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Differential  Diagnosis
  </p>
  <p>
   Motor impairments due to another medical condition.  Problems in coordination may
  </p>
  <p>
   be associated with visual function impairment and specific neurological disorders (e.g.,
  </p>
  <p>
   cerebral palsy, progressive lesions of the cerebellum, neuromuscular disorders). In such
  </p>
  <p>
   cases, there are additional findings on neurological examination.
  </p>
  <p>
   Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).
  </p>
  <p>
   If intellectual disability is
  </p>
  <p>
   present, motor competences may be impaired in accordance with the intellectual disabil-
  </p>
  <p>
   ity. However, if the motor difficulties are in excess of what could be accounted for by the
  </p>
  <p>
   intellectual disability, and criteria for developmental coordination disorder are met, de-
  </p>
  <p>
   velopmental coordination disorder can be diagnosed as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
  </p>
  <p>
   Individuals with ADHD may fall, bump into
  </p>
  <p>
   objects, or knock things over. Careful observation across different contexts is required to
  </p>
  <p>
   ascertain if lack of motor competence is attributable to distractibility and impulsiveness
  </p>
  <p>
   rather than to developmental coordination disorder. If criteria for both ADHD and devel-
  </p>
  <p>
   opmental coordination disorder are met, both diagnoses can be given.
  </p>
  <p>
   Autism spectrum disorder.
  </p>
  <p>
   Individuals with autism spectrum disorder may be uninter-
  </p>
  <p>
   ested in participating in tasks requiring complex coordination skills, such as ball sports,
  </p>
  <p>
   which will affect test performance and function but not reflect core motor competence. Co-
  </p>
  <p>
   occurrence of developmental coordination disorder and autism spectrum disorder is com-
  </p>
  <p>
   mon. If criteria for both disorders are met, both diagnoses can be given.
  </p>
  <p>
   Joint hypermobility syndrome.
  </p>
  <p>
   Individuals with syndromes causing hyperextensible
  </p>
  <p>
   joints (found on physical examination; often with a complaint of pain) may present with
  </p>
  <p>
   symptoms similar to those of developmental coordination disorder.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Comorbidity
  </h3>
  <p>
   Disorders that commonly co-occur with developmental coordination disorder include
  </p>
  <p>
   speech and language disorder; specific learning disorder (especially reading and writing);
  </p>
  <p>
   problems of inattention, including ADHD (the most frequent coexisting condition, with
  </p>
  <p>
   about 50% co-occurrence); autism spectrum disorder; disruptive and emotional behavior
  </p>
  <p>
   problems; and joint hypermobility syndrome. Different clusters of co-occurrence may be
  </p>
  <p>
   present (e.g., a cluster with severe reading disorders, fine motor problems, and handwriting
  </p>
  <p>
   problems; another cluster with impaired movement control and motor planning). Presence
  </p>
  <p>
   of other disorders does not exclude developmental coordination disorder but may make
  </p>
  <p>
   testing more difficult and may independently interfere with the execution of activities of
  </p>
  <p>
   daily living, thus requiring examiner judgment in ascribing impairment to motor skills.

  <h2>
   Stereotypic Movement Disorder
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Diagnostic Criteria
  </h3>
  <p>
   307.3 (F98.4)
  </p>
  <p>
   A.  Repetitive,  seemingly driven,  and apparently purposeless motor behavior (e.g.,  hand
  </p>
  <p>
   shaking or waving,  body rocking, head banging, self-biting,  hitting own body).
  </p>
  <p>
   B.  The  repetitive  motor behavior interferes with  social,  academic,  or other activities and
  </p>
  <p>
   may result in self-injury.
  </p>
  <p>
   C.  Onset is in the early developmental period.
  </p>
  <p>
   D.  The  repetitive  motor behavior  is  not  attributable  to  the  physiological  effects  of  a  sub-
  </p>
  <p>
   stance  or  neurological  condition  and  is  not  better  explained  by  another  neurodevel-
  </p>
  <p>
   opmental  or  mental  disorder  (e.g.,  trichotillomania  [hair-pulling  disorder],  obsessive-
  </p>
  <p>
   compulsive disorder).
  </p>
  <p>
   Specify if:
  </p>
  <p>
   With  self-injurious  behavior  (or behavior that would  result in an  injury  if preventive
  </p>
  <p>
   measures were not used)
  </p>
  <p>
   W ithout self-injurious behavior
  </p>
  <p>
   Specify if:
  </p>
  <p>
   Associated with a known medical or genetic condition, neurodevelopmental dis-
  </p>
  <p>
   order,  or  environmental  factor  (e.g.,  Lesch-Nyhan  syndrome,  intellectual  disability
  </p>
  <p>
   [intellectual developmental disorder],  intrauterine alcohol exposure)
  </p>
  <p>
   Coding  note:  Use  additional  code  to  identify  the  associated  medical  or  genetic
  </p>
  <p>
   condition, or neurodevelopmental disorder.
  </p>
  <p>
   Specify current severity:
  </p>
  <p>
   Mild:  Symptoms are easily suppressed by sensory stimulus or distraction.
  </p>
  <p>
   Moderate: Symptoms require explicit protective measures and behavioral modification.
  </p>
  <p>
   Severe:  Continuous monitoring and protective measures are required to prevent seri-
  </p>
  <p>
   ous injury.
  </p>
  <p>
   Recording  Procedures
  </p>
  <p>
   For stereotypic movement disorder that is associated with a known medical or genetic
  </p>
  <p>
   condition, neurodevelopmental  disorder,  or environmental  factor,  record  stereotypic
  </p>
  <p>
   movement disorder associated with (name of condition, disorder, or factor)  (e.g., stereo-
  </p>
  <p>
   typic movement disorder associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome).
  </p>
  <p>
   Specifiers
  </p>
  <p>
   The severity of non-self-injurious stereotypic movements ranges from mild presentations
  </p>
  <p>
   that are easily suppressed by a sensory stimulus or distraction to continuous movements
  </p>
  <p>
   that markedly interfere with all activities of daily living. Self-injurious behaviors range in se-
  </p>
  <p>
   verity along various dimensions, including the frequency, impact on adaptive functioning,
  </p>
  <p>
   and severity of bodily injury (from mild bruising or erythema from hitting hand against
  </p>
  <p>
   body, to lacerations or amputation of digits, to retinal detachment from head banging).
  </p>
  <p>
   Diagnostic  Features
  </p>
  <p>
   The essential feature of stereotypic movement disorder is repetitive, seemingly driven,
  </p>
  <p>
   and apparently purposeless motor behavior  (Criterion A).  These behaviors  are often
  </p>
  <p>
   rhythmical movements of the head, hands, or body without obvious adaptive function.
  </p>
  <p>
   The movements may or may not respond to efforts to stop them. Among typically devel-
  </p>
  <p>
   oping children, the repetitive movements may be stopped when attention is directed to
  </p>
  <p>
   them or when the child is distracted from performing them. Among children with neuro-
  </p>
  <p>
   developmental disorders, the behaviors are typically less responsive to such efforts.  In
  </p>
  <p>
   other cases, the individual demonstrates self-restraining behaviors (e.g., sitting on hands,
  </p>
  <p>
   wrapping arms in clothing, finding a protective device).
  </p>
  <p>
   The repertoire of behaviors is variable; each individual presents with his or her own in-
  </p>
  <p>
   dividually patterned, "signature" behavior.  Examples of non-self-injurious stereotypic
  </p>
  <p>
   movements include, but are not limited to, body rocking, bilateral flapping or rotating
  </p>
  <p>
   hand movements, flicking or fluttering fingers in front of the face, arm waving or flapping,
  </p>
  <p>
   and head nodding. Stereotyped self-injurious behaviors include, but are not limited to, re-
  </p>
  <p>
   petitive head banging, face slapping, eye poking, and biting of hands, lips, or other body
  </p>
  <p>
   parts. Eye poking is particularly concerning; it occurs more frequently among children
  </p>
  <p>
   with visual impairment. Multiple movements may be combined (e.g., cocking the head,
  </p>
  <p>
   rocking the torso, waving a small string repetitively in front of the face).
  </p>
  <p>
   Stereotypic movements may occur many times during a day, lasting a few seconds to
  </p>
  <p>
   several minutes or longer. Frequency can vary from many occurrences in a single day to
  </p>
  <p>
   several weeks elapsing between episodes. The behaviors vary in context, occurring when
  </p>
  <p>
   the individual is engrossed in other activities, when excited, stressed, fatigued, or bored.
  </p>
  <p>
   Criterion A requires that the movements be "apparently" purposeless.  However, some
  </p>
  <p>
   functions may be served by the movements. For example, stereotypic movements might
  </p>
  <p>
   reduce anxiety in response to external stressors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Criterion B states that the stereotypic movements interfere with social, academic, or
  </p>
  <p>
   other activities and, in some children, may result in self-injury (or would if protective mea-
  </p>
  <p>
   sures were not used). If self-injury is present, it should be coded using the specifier. Onset
  </p>
  <p>
   of stereotypic movements is in the early developmental period (Criterion C). Criterion D
  </p>
  <p>
   states that the repetitive, stereotyped behavior in stereotypic movement disorder is not at-
  </p>
  <p>
   tributable to the^physiological effects of a substance or neurological condition and is not
  </p>
  <p>
   better explained by another neurodevelopmental or mental disorder. The presence of
  </p>
  <p>
   stereotypic movements may indicate an undetected neurodevelopmental problem, espe-
  </p>
  <p>
   cially in children ages 1-3 years.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Prevalence
  </h3>
  <p>
   Simple stereotypic movements (e.g., rocking) are common in young typically developing chil-
  </p>
  <p>
   dren. Complex stereotypic movements are much less common (occurring in approximately
  </p>
  <p>
   3%-4%). Between 4% and 16°/« of individuals v^ith intellectual disability (intellectual develop-
  </p>
  <p>
   mental disorder) engage in stereotypy and self-injury. The risk is greater in individuals with
  </p>
  <p>
   severe intellectual disability. Among individuals with intellectual disability living in res-
  </p>
  <p>
   idential facilities, 10%-15% may have stereotypic movement disorder with self-injury.
  </p>
  <p>
   Development and  Course
  </p>
  <p>
   Stereotypic movements typically begin within the first 3 years of life. Simple stereotypic move-
  </p>
  <p>
   ments are common in infancy and may be involved in acquisition of motor mastery. In chil-
  </p>
  <p>
   dren who develop complex motor stereotypies, approximately 80% exhibit symptoms before
  </p>
  <p>
   24 months of age, 12% between 24 and 35 months, and 8% at 36 months or older. In most typ-
  </p>
  <p>
   ically developing children, these movements resolve over time or can be suppressed. Onset of
  </p>
  <p>
   complex motor stereotypies may be in infancy or later in the developmental period. Among
  </p>
  <p>
   individuals with intellectual disability, the stereotyped, self-injurious behaviors may persist
  </p>
  <p>
   for years, even though the typography or pattern of self-injury may change.
  </p>
  <p>
   Risk and  Prognostic  Factors
  </p>
  <p>
   Environmental.  Social isolation is a risk factor for self-stimulation that may progress to
  </p>
  <p>
   stereotypic movements with repetitive self-injury. Environmental stress may also trigger
  </p>
  <p>
   stereotypic behavior. Fear may alter physiological state, resulting in increased frequency
  </p>
  <p>
   of stereotypic behaviors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Genetic and physiological.  Lower cognitive functioning is linked to greater risk for stereo-
  </p>
  <p>
   typic behaviors and poorer response to interventions. Stereotypic movements are more fre-
  </p>
  <p>
   quent among individuals with moderate-to-severe/profound intellectual disability, who by
  </p>
  <p>
   virtue of a particular syndrome (e.g., Rett syndrome) or environmental factor (e.g., an environ-
  </p>
  <p>
   ment with relatively insufficient stimulation) seem to be at higher risk for stereotypies. Repet-
  </p>
  <p>
   itive self-injurious behavior may be a behavioral phenotype in neurogenetic syndromes. For
  </p>
  <p>
   example, in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, there are both stereotypic dystonie movements and self-
  </p>
  <p>
   mutilation of fingers, lip biting, and other forms of self-injury unless the individual is re-
  </p>
  <p>
   strained, and in Rett syndrome and Cornelia de Lange syndrome, self-injury may result from
  </p>
  <p>
   the hand-to-mouth stereotypies. Stereotypic behaviors may result from a painful medical con-
  </p>
  <p>
   dition (e.g., middle ear infection, dental problems, gastroesophageal reflux).
  </p>
  <p>
   Culture-Related  Diagnostic  Issues
  </p>
  <p>
   Stereotypic movement disorder, with or without self-injury, occurs in all races and cultures.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cultural attitudes toward unusual behaviors may result in delayed diagnosis. Overall cultural
  </p>
  <p>
   tolerance and attitudes toward stereotypic movement vary and must be considered.
  </p>
  <p>
   Differential  Diagnosis
  </p>
  <p>
   Normal development.  Simple stereotypic movements are common in infancy and early
  </p>
  <p>
   childhood. Rocking may occur in the transition from sleep to awake, a behavior that usu-
  </p>
  <p>
   ally resolves with age. Complex stereotypies are less common in typically developing
  </p>
  <p>
   children and can usually be suppressed by distraction or sensory stimulation. The indi-
  </p>
  <p>
   vidual's daily routine is rarely affected, and the movements generally do not cause the
  </p>
  <p>
   child distress. The diagnosis would not be appropriate in these circumstances.
  </p>
  <p>
   Autism spectrum disorder.  Stereotypic movements may be a presenting symptom of
  </p>
  <p>
   autism spectrum disorder and should be considered when repetitive movements and be-
  </p>
  <p>
   haviors are being evaluated. Deficits of social communication and reciprocity manifesting
  </p>
  <p>
   in autism spectrum disorder are generally absent in stereotypic movement disorder, and
  </p>
  <p>
   thus social interaction, social communication, and rigid repetitive behaviors and interests
  </p>
  <p>
   are distinguishing features. When autism spectrum disorder is present, stereotypic move-
  </p>
  <p>
   ment disorder is diagnosed only when there is self-injury or when the stereotypic behav-
  </p>
  <p>
   iors are sufficiently severe to become a focus of treatment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tic disorders.  Typically, stereotypies have an earlier age at onset (before 3 years) than
  </p>
  <p>
   do tics, which have a mean age at onset of 5-7 years. They are consistent and fixed in their
  </p>
  <p>
   pattern or topography compared with tics, which are variable in their presentation. Ste-
  </p>
  <p>
   reotypies may involve arms, hands, or the entire body, while tics commonly involve eyes,
  </p>
  <p>
   face, head, and shoulders. Stereotypies are more fixed, rhythmic, and prolonged in dura-
  </p>
  <p>
   tion than tics, which, generally, are brief, rapid, random, and fluctuating. Tics and stereo-
  </p>
  <p>
   typic movements are both reduced by distraction.
  </p>
  <p>
   Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.  Stereotypic movement disorder is dis-
  </p>
  <p>
   tinguished from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) by the absence of obsessions, as
  </p>
  <p>
   well as by the nature of the repetitive behaviors. In OCD the individual feels driven to per-
  </p>
  <p>
   form repetitive behaviors in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be ap-
  </p>
  <p>
   plied rigidly, whereas in stereotypic movement disorder the behaviors are seemingly
  </p>
  <p>
   driven but apparently purposeless. Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) and excoria-
  </p>
  <p>
   tion (skin-picking) disorder are characterized by body-focused repetitive behaviors (i.e.,
  </p>
  <p>
   hair pulling and skin picking) that may be seemingly driven but that are not apparently
  </p>
  <p>
   purposeless, and that may not be patterned or rhythmical. Furthermore, onset in tricho-
  </p>
  <p>
   tillomania and excoriation disorder is not typically in the early developmental period, but
  </p>
  <p>
   rather around puberty or later.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other neurological and medical conditions.  The diagnosis of stereotypic movements
  </p>
  <p>
   requires the exclusion of habits, mannerisms, paroxysmal dyskinesias, and benign he-
  </p>
  <p>
   reditary chorea. A neurological history and examination are required to assess features
  </p>
  <p>
   suggestive of other disorders, such as myoclonus, dystonia, tics, and chorea. Involuntary
  </p>
  <p>
   movements associated with a neurological condition may be distinguished by their signs
  </p>
  <p>
   and symptoms. For example, repetitive, stereotypic movements in tardive dyskinesia can
  </p>
  <p>
   be distinguished by a history of chronic neuroleptic use and characteristic oral or facial
  </p>
  <p>
   dyskinesia or irregular trunk or limb movements. These types of movements do not result
  </p>
  <p>
   in self-injury. A diagnosis of stereotypic movement disorder is not appropriate for repet-
  </p>
  <p>
   itive skin picking or scratching associated with amphetamine intoxication or abuse (e.g.,
  </p>
  <p>
   patients are diagnosed with substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and re-
  </p>
  <p>
   lated disorder) and repetitive choreoathetoid movements associated with other neurolog-
  </p>
  <p>
   ical disorders.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Comorbidity
  </h3>
  <p>
   Stereotypic movement disorder may occur as a primary diagnosis or secondary to another
  </p>
  <p>
   disorder.  For example, stereotypies are a common manifestation of a variety of neuro-
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   Specifiers
  </p>
  <p>
   The "motor tics only" or "vocal tics only" specifier is only required for persistent (chronic)
  </p>
  <p>
   motor or vocal tic disorder.
  </p>
  <p>
   Diagnostic  Features
  </p>
  <p>
   Tic disorders comprise four diagnostic categories: Tourette's disorder, persistent (chronic)
  </p>
  <p>
   motor or vocal tic disorder, provisional tic disorder, and the other specified and unspecified
  </p>
  <p>
   tic disorders. Diagnosis for any tic disorder is based on the presence of motor and/or vocal
  </p>
  <p>
   tics (Criterion A), duration of tic symptoms (Criterion B), age at onset (Criterion C), and ab-
  </p>
  <p>
   sence of any known cause such as another medical condition or substance use (Criterion D).
  </p>
  <p>
   The tic disorders are hierarchical in order (i.e., Tourette's disorder, followed by persistent
  </p>
  <p>
   [chronic] motor or vocal tic disorder, followed by provisional tic disorder, followed by the
  </p>
  <p>
   other specified and unspecified tic disorders), such that once a tic disorder at one level of the
  </p>
  <p>
   hierarchy is diagnosed, a lower hierarchy diagnosis cannot be made (Criterion E).
  </p>
  <p>
   Tics are sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movements or vocalizations. An
  </p>
  <p>
   individual may have various tic symptoms over time, but at any point in time, the tic rep-
  </p>
  <p>
   ertoire recurs in a characteristic fashion. Although tics can include almost any muscle group
  </p>
  <p>
   or vocalization, certain tic symptoms, such as eye blinking or throat clearing, are common
  </p>
  <p>
   across patient populations. Tics are generally experienced as involuntary but can be vol-
  </p>
  <p>
   untarily suppressed for varying lengths of time.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tics can be either simple or complex. Simple motor tics are of short duration (i.e., milli-
  </p>
  <p>
   seconds) and can include eye blinking, shoulder shrugging, and extension of the extrem-
  </p>
  <p>
   ities.  Simple vocal  tics include  throat clearing, sniffing, and grunting often caused by
  </p>
  <p>
   contraction of the diaphragm or muscles of the oropharynx. Complex motor tics are of lon-
  </p>
  <p>
   ger duration (i.e., seconds) and often include a combination of simple tics such as simul-
  </p>
  <p>
   taneous head turning and shoulder shrugging. Complex tics can appear purposeful, such
  </p>
  <p>
   as a tic-like sexual or obscene gesture (copropraxia) or a tic-like imitation of someone else's
  </p>
  <p>
   movements (echopraxia). Similarly, complex vocal tics include repeating one's own sounds
  </p>
  <p>
   or words {palilalia), repeating the last-heard word or phrase (echolalia), or uttering socially
  </p>
  <p>
   unacceptable words, including obscenities, or ethnic, racial, or religious slurs (coprolalia).
  </p>
  <p>
   Importantly, coprolalia is an abrupt, sharp bark or grunt utterance and lacks the prosody
  </p>
  <p>
   of similar inappropriate speech observed in human interactions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The presence of motor and/or vocal tics varies across the four tic disorders (Criterion
  </p>
  <p>
   A). For Tourette's disorder, both motor and vocal tics must be present, whereas for per-
  </p>
  <p>
   sistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder, only motor or only vocal tics are present. For
  </p>
  <p>
   provisional tic disorder, motor and/or vocal tics may be present. For other specified or un-
  </p>
  <p>
   specified tic disorders, the movement disorder symptoms are best characterized as tics but
  </p>
  <p>
   are atypical in presentation or age at onset, or have a known etiology.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1-year minimum duration criterion (Criterion B)  assures that individuals diag-
  </p>
  <p>
   nosed with either Tourette's disorder or persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder
  </p>
  <p>
   have had persistent symptoms. Tics wax and wane in severity, and some individuals may
  </p>
  <p>
   have tic-free periods of weeks to months; however, an individual who has had tic symp-
  </p>
  <p>
   toms of greater than 1 year's duration since first tic onset would be considered to have per-
  </p>
  <p>
   sistent symptoms regardless of duration of tic-free periods. For an individual with motor
  </p>
  <p>
   and/or vocal tics of less than 1 year since first tic onset, a provisional tic disorder diagnosis
  </p>
  <p>
   can be considered. There is no duration specification for other specified and unspecified tic
  </p>
  <p>
   disorders. The onset of tics must occur prior to age 18 years (Criterion C). Tic disorders
  </p>
  <p>
   typically begin in the prepubertal period, with an average age at onset between 4 and 6
  </p>
  <p>
   years, and with the incidence of new-onset tic disorders decreasing in the teen years. New
  </p>
  <p>
   onset of tic symptoms in adulthood is exceedingly rare and is often associated with expo-
  </p>
  <p>
   sures to drugs (e.g., excessive cocaine use) or is a result of a central nervous system insult
  </p>
  <p>
   (e.g., postviral encephalitis). Although tic onset is uncommon in teenagers and adults, it is
  </p>
  <p>
   not uncommon for adolescents and adults to present for an initial diagnostic assessment
  </p>
  <p>
   and, when carefully evaluated, provide a history of milder symptoms dating back to child-
  </p>
  <p>
   hood. New-onset abnormal movements suggestive of tics outside of the usual age range
  </p>
  <p>
   should result in evaluation for other movement disorders or for specific etiologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tic symptoms cannot be attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or an-
  </p>
  <p>
   other medical condition (Criterion D). When there is strong evidence from the history,
  </p>
  <p>
   physical examination, and/or laboratory results to suggest a plausible, proximal, and
  </p>
  <p>
   probable cause for a tic disorder, a diagnosis of other specified tic disorder should be used.
  </p>
  <p>
   Having previously met diagnostic criteria for Tourette's disorder negates a possible di-
  </p>
  <p>
   agnosis of persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder (Criterion E). Similarly, a previ-
  </p>
  <p>
   ous diagnosis of persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder negates a diagnosis of
  </p>
  <p>
   provisional tic disorder or other specified or unspecified tic disorder (Criterion E).
  </p>
  <h3>
   Prevalence
  </h3>
  <p>
   Tics are common in childhood but transient in most cases. The estimated prevalence of
  </p>
  <p>
   Tourette's disorder ranges from 3 to 8 per  1,000 in school-age children. Males are more
  </p>
  <p>
   commonly affected than females, with the ratio varying from 2:1 to 4:1. A national survey
  </p>
  <p>
   in the United States estimated 3 per 1,000 for the prevalence of clinically identified cases.
  </p>
  <p>
   The frequency of identified cases was lower among African Americans and  Hispanic
  </p>
  <p>
   Americans, which may be related to differences in access to care.
  </p>
  <p>
   Development and  Course
  </p>
  <p>
   Onset of tics is typically between ages 4 and 6 years. Peak severity occurs between ages 10
  </p>
  <p>
   and 12 years, with a decline in severity during adolescence. Many adults with tic disorders
  </p>
  <p>
   experience diminished symptoms.  A small percentage of individuals will have persis-
  </p>
  <p>
   tently severe or worsening symptoms in adulthood.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tic symptoms manifest similarly in all age groups and across the lifespan. Tics wax and
  </p>
  <p>
   wane in severity and change in affected muscle groups and vocalizations over time. As
  </p>
  <p>
   children get older, they begin to report their tics being associated  with a premonitory
  </p>
  <p>
   urge—a somatic sensation that precedes the tic—and a feeling of tension reduction follow-
  </p>
  <p>
   ing the expression of the tic. Tics associated with a premonitory urge may be experienced
  </p>
  <p>
   as not completely ''involuntary" in that the urge and the tic can be resisted. An individual
  </p>
  <p>
   may also feel the need to perform a tic in a specific way or repeat it until he or she achieves
  </p>
  <p>
   the feeling that the tic has been done "'just right."
  </p>
  <p>
   The vulnerability toward developing co-occurring conditions changes as individuals
  </p>
  <p>
   pass through the age of risk for various co-occurring conditions. For example, prepubertal
  </p>
  <p>
   children with tic disorders are more likely to experience attention-deficit/hyperactivity
  </p>
  <p>
   disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and separation anxiety disorder
  </p>
  <p>
   than are teenagers and adults, who are more likely to experience the new onset of major
  </p>
  <p>
   depressive disorder, substance use disorder, or bipolar disorder.
  </p>
  <p>
   Risk and  Prognostic  Factors
  </p>
  <p>
   Temperamental.  Tics are worsened by anxiety, excitement, and exhaustion and are better
  </p>
  <p>
   during calm, focused activities. Individuals may have fewer tics when engaged in schoolwork
  </p>
  <p>
   or tasks at work than when relaxing at home after school or in the evening. Stressful/exciting
  </p>
  <p>
   events (e.g., taking a test, participating in exciting activities) often make tics worse.
  </p>
  <p>
   Environmental.  Observing a gesture or sound in another person may result in an indi-
  </p>
  <p>
   vidual with a tic disorder making a similar gesture or sound, which may be incorrectly
  </p>
  <p>
   perceived by others as purposeful. This can be a particular problem when the individual is
  </p>
  <p>
   interacting with authority figures (e.g., teachers, supervisors, police).
  </p>
  <p>
   Genetic and  physiological.  Genetic and environmental factors influence tic symptom
  </p>
  <p>
   expression and severity.  Important risk alleles for Tourette's disorder and rare genetic
  </p>
  <p>
   variants in families with tic disorders have been identified. Obstetrical complications,
  </p>
  <p>
   older paternal age, lower birth weight, and maternal smoking during pregnancy are as-
  </p>
  <p>
   sociated with worse tic severity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Culture-Related  Diagnostic  Issues
  </p>
  <p>
   Tic disorders do not appear to vary in clinical characteristics, course, or etiology by race,
  </p>
  <p>
   ethnicity, and culture. However, race, ethnicity, and culture may impact how tic disorders
  </p>
  <p>
   are perceived and managed in the family and community, as well as influencing patterns
  </p>
  <p>
   of help seeking, and choices of treatment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gender-Related  Diagnostic  Issues
  </p>
  <p>
   Males are more commonly affected than females, but there are no gender differences in the
  </p>
  <p>
   kinds of tics, age at onset, or course. Women with persistent tic disorders may be more
  </p>
  <p>
   likely to experience anxiety and depression.
  </p>
  <p>
   Functional  Consequences of Tic  Disorders
  </p>
  <p>
   Many individuals with mild to moderate tic severity experience no distress or impairment
  </p>
  <p>
   in functioning and may even be unaware of their tics. Individuals with more severe symp-
  </p>
  <p>
   toms generally have more impairment in daily living, but even individuals with moderate
  </p>
  <p>
   or even severe tic disorders may function well. The presence of a co-occurring condition,
  </p>
  <p>
   such as ADHD or OCD, can have greater impact on functioning. Less commonly, tics dis-
  </p>
  <p>
   rupt functioning in daily activities and result in social isolation, interpersonal conflict,
  </p>
  <p>
   peer victimization, inability to work or to go to school, and lower quality of life. The indi-
  </p>
  <p>
   vidual also may experience substantial psychological distress. Rare complications of Tou-
  </p>
  <p>
   rette's disorder include physical injury, such as eye injury (from hitting oneself in the face),
  </p>
  <p>
   and orthopedic and neurological injury (e.g., disc disease related to forceful head and neck
  </p>
  <p>
   movements).
  </p>
  <p>
   Differential  Diagnosis
  </p>
  <p>
   Abnormal movements that may accompany other medical conditions and stereotypic
  </p>
  <p>
   movement disorder.  Motor stereotypies are defined as involuntary rhythmic, repetitive,
  </p>
  <p>
   predictable movements that appear purposeful but serve no obvious adaptive function or
  </p>
  <p>
   purpose and stop with distraction. Examples include repetitive hand waving/rotating,
  </p>
  <p>
   arm flapping, and finger wiggling. Motor stereotypies can be differentiated from tics based
  </p>
  <p>
   on the former's earlier age at onset (younger than 3 years), prolonged duration (seconds to
  </p>
  <p>
   minutes), constant repetitive fixed form and location, exacerbation when engrossed in ac-
  </p>
  <p>
   tivities, lack of a premonitory urge, and cessation with distraction (e.g., name called or
  </p>
  <p>
   touched).  Chorea represents rapid, random, continual, abrupt, irregular, unpredictable,
  </p>
  <p>
   nonstereotyped actions that are usually bilateral and affect all parts of the body (i.e., face,
  </p>
  <p>
   trunk, and limbs). The timing, direction, and distribution of movements vary from mo-
  </p>
  <p>
   ment to moment, and movements usually worsen during attempted voluntary action. Dys-
  </p>
  <p>
   tonia is the simultaneous sustained contracture of both agonist and antagonist muscles,
  </p>
  <p>
   resulting in a distorted posture or movement of parts of the body. Dystonie postures are of-
  </p>
  <p>
   ten triggered by attempts at voluntary movements and are not seen during sleep.
  </p>
  <p>
   Substance-induced and paroxysmal dyskinesias.  Paroxysmal dyskinesias usually oc-
  </p>
  <p>
   cur as dystonie or choreoathetoid movements that are precipitated by voluntary move-
  </p>
  <p>
   ment or exertion and less commonly arise from normal background activity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Myoclonus.  Myoclonus is characterized by a sudden unidirectional movement that is
  </p>
  <p>
   often nonrhythmic. It may be worsened by movement and occur during sleep. Myoclonus
  </p>
  <p>
   is differentiated from tics by its rapidity, lack of suppressibility, and absence of a premon-
  </p>
  <p>
   itory urge.
  </p>
  <p>
   Obsessive-compulsive and  related disorders.  Differentiating obsessive-compulsive
  </p>
  <p>
   behaviors from tics may be difficult. Clues favoring an obsessive-compulsive behavior in-
  </p>
  <p>
   clude a cognitive-based drive (e.g., fear of contamination) and the need to perform the ac-
  </p>
  <p>
   tion in a particular fashion a certain number of times, equally on both sides of the body, or
  </p>
  <p>
   until a "just right" feeling is achieved. Impulse-control problems and other repetitive be-
  </p>
  <p>
   haviors, including persistent hair pulling, skin picking, and nail biting, appear more goal
  </p>
  <p>
   directed and complex than tics.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Comorbidity
  </h3>
  <p>
   Many medical and psychiatric conditions have been described as co-occurring with tic disor-
  </p>
  <p>
   ders, with ADHD and obsessive-compulsive and related disorders being particularly com-
  </p>
  <p>
   mon. The obsessive-compulsive symptoms observed in tic disorder tend to be characterized
  </p>
  <p>
   by more aggressive symmetry and order symptoms and poorer response to pharmacotherapy
  </p>
  <p>
   with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Children with ADHD may demonstrate disrup-
  </p>
  <p>
   tive behavior, social immaturity, and learning difficulties that may interfere with academic
  </p>
  <p>
   progress and interpersonal relationships and lead to greater impairment than that caused by a
  </p>
  <p>
   tic disorder. Individuals with tic disorders can also have other movement disorders and other
  </p>
  <p>
   mental disorders, such as depressive, bipolar, or substance use disorders.
  </p>
